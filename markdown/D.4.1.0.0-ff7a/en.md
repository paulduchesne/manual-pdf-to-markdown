D.4.1 Publication

For  Works/Variants,  a  Publication  Event  corresponds  to  the  first  verified  release  or
availability of the Work or Variant, whether theatrical, straight-to-video, broadcast or
online transmission, etc.

For Manifestations, a Publication Event corresponds to a screening, broadcast or the

release  of  the  Manifestation  of  a  Work/Variant  on  a  physical  distribution  medium  or
online.

A Publication Event may be associated with instances of Agent in the role of e.g., pub-
lisher, distributor, broadcaster204, etc. See D.8 Manifestation Agent Types and D.3 Work/
Variant Agent Types.

A Publication Event may be associated with instances of “Other” relationship(s) (e.g.,
promotional  material  of  the  theatrical  distribution,  the  advertising  of  the  home  video
publication, etc.).

Record all the existing relationships of a Publication Event, if the information is known

and considered of relevance.

Publication Event information consists of the following sub-elements:

•	 Publication type
•	 Publication date
•	 Region

•	 Publication type

For Works/Variants, record the type of Publication Event for Works/Variants, for exam-
ple, publication, release, distribution, broadcast, online transmission. Selection should
be made from a controlled list of values. See D.10 Manifestation Publication Types.

Record the Publication type for Manifestations, for example, “pre-release,” “theat-
rical distribution,” etc. Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms. See
D.10 Manifestation Publication Types.

For Manifestations, the Publication Event that originated the embodiment of a specific
Work/Variant in a Manifestation, corresponds to criteria individuated to distinguish the
boundaries between Manifestations. For this reason, conceptually, and also in practice,
“publication type” overlaps the main definition of “Manifestation type,” as explained in
2.1 Boundaries between Manifestations and, as such, is already described. Institutions
have the option to decide whether to repeat this information or not.

•	 Publication date

Record the date on which Work/Variant or Manifestation was released or otherwise
made available. Dates should be formatted according to ISO 8601 or some other rec-
ognised standard.

•	 Region

Record the country or other political or physical geographic entity where the Publi-
cation Event took place (e.g. first projection in the framework of a theatrical distri-
bution) or made the Work/Variant or Manifestation available (e.g. distribution area).

204 Some institutions specifically dealing with TV material may wish to use an actual “TV Transmission Mani-
festation” for this data.



If  known  and  considered  of  relevance,  record  the  name  of  the  city  or  smaller  geo-
graphic entity where the Publication Event took place.

For  the  treatment  of  the  geographical  names,  see  Getty  Thesaurus  of  Geographic
Names (TGN), or some other recognised standard.

If known and considered of relevance, record the name of the event that the publication
was a part of (e.g., name of a film festival, distribution channel of a broadcaster, etc.)

If known and considered of relevance, record the specific restrictions for accessing
the content (e.g. press-screening only, airplanes only, etc.).
