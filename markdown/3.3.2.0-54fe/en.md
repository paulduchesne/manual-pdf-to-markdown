3.3.2 Events

An Event characterises occurrences in the life cycle of a moving image Item. Instanc-

es of any Event type can have Agent and “Other” relationships.

Record one or more Event types, for example, “preservation,” “inspection,” “acquisi-
tion”, etc., to express the nature of the Event’s relationship to the Item. Selection should
be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaus-
tive, can be found in D.4 Event Types.
