2.4.3 “Other” relationships

Expresses  relationships  that  are  not  covered  by  the  Agent  and  Event  relationships.
Aggregation relationships are expressed at the Work/Variant level (see Appendix E, Ag-
gregates).

Commonly-occurring relationships include:

•	 Manifestations that the moving image Manifestation forms part of (e.g. se-

ries/serials)

Le cryptogramme rouge (35mm print, m 984, m 48’ (18fps)
3° episode of the serial Les vampires (L. Feuillade, 1915).

•	 Manifestation(s) that the moving image Manifestation has a sequential rela-

tionship with (e.g. series/serials)

•	 Manifestation(s) that are promotional material(s) (i.e. trailers) for a particu-

lar Manifestation

Record one or more “Other” relationship type to express the nature of the relation-
ship to the Manifestation, choosing the most specific term possible from existing relator
terms lists, for example, “commentary on,” “review of,” etc. Selection should be made
from a controlled list of values. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can
be found in Appendix D.17.2 Manifestation Other Relationship Types.

Or,  compose  a  term  to  describe  the  relationship  between  the  Manifestation  being

catalogued and the related Manifestation.

In a note, add any additional information concerning the relationship considered relevant.

Describe or demonstrate Manifestation-to-Manifestation relationships through link-
ing  to  the  Manifestation  identifier  of  the  related  Manifestation,  through  the  usage  of
relator terms, or according to the confines of your data structure.

If the cataloguing system allows the procedure, attach a digital file that reproduces

any associated “document.”
