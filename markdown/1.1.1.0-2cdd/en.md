1.1.1 Boundaries between Works

These  guidelines  recognise  that  real  world  cataloguing  needs  and  data  structures
necessitate practical applications of conceptual modelling. To that end, the recommen-
dations made in this chapter about determining boundaries for Works and Variants are
based on an approach that emphasizes effective, efficient and economic data creation
and maintenance: information that is common to all realisations of a Work or Variant
is recorded once and is comprised of the shared information that will not change (for
example, title, original creation date, creator, etc.). The Work description or record con-
tains the index terms for describing a Work in the catalogue and fulfills the functions of
disambiguation (distinguishes Works containing similar or identical titles) and colloca-
tion (brings together all the materials that are related to the Work and all Variants of a
given Work). Variations in information describing the Work result in Variants or Manifes-
tations, or new Works.

The boundaries between one Work and another (i.e. where a new Work would be cre-
ated rather than a Variant) are drawn on the basis of the following alterations to the
content:31

Change in footage and/or changes in continuity (primary editing)32

•

remakes of the same story/plot

Examples:

The man who knew too much (UK, 1934, Alfred Hitchcock)
The man who knew too much (UK, 1936, Alfred Hitchcock)

T’amerò sempre (Italy, 1933, Mario Camerini)
T’amerò sempre (Italy, 1943, Mario Camerini)

Planet of the apes (USA, 1968, Franklin J. Schaffner)
Planet of the apes (USA, 2001, Tim Burton)

Scarface (USA, 1932, Howard Hawks)
Scarface (USA, 1983, Brian De Palma)

Die Dreigroschenoper (Germany, 1931, Georg Wilhelm Pabst)
Die Dreigroschenoper (Germany,1962, Wolfgang Staudte)

•

different language versions shot at the same time, released simultaneously,
sometimes with different casts

Examples:

Dracula (USA, 1931, Tod Browning, Spanish and English)

31  The types of alterations given here are adapted from Yee, “The Concept of Work for Moving Image Materials.”
32  Secondary editing results in a Variant.



Anna Christie (USA, 1930, Clarence Brown, English; 1931, German)

Der Fangschuß (France/Germany, 1976, Volker Schlöndorff, German)
Le Coup de grâce (France/Germany, 1976, Volker Schlöndorff, French)

Die Dreigroschenoper (Germany, 1931, Georg Wilhelm Pabst, German)
L’opéra de quat’sous (France, 1931, Georg Wilhelm Pabst, French)

La canzone dell’amore (USA, 1930, Gennaro Righelli, English)
Liebeslied (Germany, 1930, Constantin J. Davis, German)
La dernière berceuse (France, 1930, Jean Cassagne, French)

•

editing of the same raw footage by different people into different sequences

Example:

Several  separate  Works  made  from  the  footage  taken  on  Captain
Robert Falcon Scott’s Antarctic expedition, 1910-13.

Change in textual or spoken word aspect

•

complete alteration of dialogue and/or narration of an existing work

Example: What’s Up Tiger Lily (1966)

Change in performance/performers

•

each cinematographic realisation of a dramatic work

Examples:

Moving  image  representations  of  theatrical  performances  of  Shake-
speare’s Macbeth, where there is removal and/or replacement of sub-
stantially most of the contributors (e.g., cast and/or crew), associated
with a work

Chickens  Come  Home  (1931)  where  the  film  was  first  shot  in  English,
then  re-shot  with  Spanish  dialogue  and  additional  Spanish-speaking
actors.

If much of the original textual or spoken word material remains, most of the original
footage  remains  in  roughly  the  same  continuity,  however  abridged,  and  substantially
most of the contributors are the same, the existence of alterations more often than not
constitute a Variant, rather than a new Work.
