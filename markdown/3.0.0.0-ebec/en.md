3.0 Definition

A moving image Item is the physical or digital product of a Manifestation of a Work
or Variant, i.e. the actual copy of a Work or Variant. Whereas the Manifestation record
describes the “ideal” of a particular format or publication, the Item record represents the
actual holding in a repository’s collection.

An Item may consist of one or more components, i.e. the whole Item may consist of 1 reel
or 5 reels, 2 VHS tapes or 1 DVD. An Item record may contain fields or scope for separate
barcodes and condition information for each component of the item (each reel for ex-
ample) if required.

The Item may be whole or incomplete or a fragment. In the case of purely digital media,
an Item is defined as the availability of the computer file, irrespective of the number of
backup copies that may exist.112
