E.4 Titling of Aggregates

The title of the aggregating Work should reflect that of the Manifestation. The com-
ponent titles may additionally be added to the aggregating Work as alternative title types
(see A.2.4 Alternative). They may also be added to any Items as alternative title types.

Titling of aggregates follows the same principles as that of other types of entities (see

Appendix A, Titles and Title Types).

The title of the aggregate Manifestation forms the basis, but that title may be a “title
proper” or a fully or partially devised/supplied title. (See A.2.2 Title Proper orA.2.5 Sup-
plied/Devised Titles).

Aggregates  may  be  formed  by  an  archive  or  institution  itself  for  in-house  or  other
event purposes. In these instances the title type should indicate it is a devised/supplied
title in both the aggregate Manifestation and aggregating Work, as well as the Item.
