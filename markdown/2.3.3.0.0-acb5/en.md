2.3.3 Language

“Language” should ideally be presented as a set of two elements: the language term,
and its usage in a particular Manifestation. Language can be present in a Manifestation
as written, spoken or sung. Its usage qualifies whether the specific language is dialogue,
dubbed, subtitles, intertitles, etc.

2.3.3.1 Language terms

Where possible, record the language(s) using the full form of name, e.g., French, Ital-
ian, etc. rather than abbreviations or codes, by taking the most suitable value(s) from a
controlled list. This can be an in-house list but it is preferable to use a standard language
list such as ISO 639 (http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php).

Optionally, record the language code as found in ISO 639.

If no language can be determined, the information can be omitted or indicated by a

value of “not known”.

2.3.3.2 Usage type

More than one language can occur in different forms, depending on how the content is
expressed: the usage type of the languages defines the form with which the language is



expressed, for example, spoken, sung, written, etc.

Record the usage type of a language by taking the most suitable value from a controlled
list. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.6 Manifesta-
tion Language Usage Types.

If usage type(s) cannot be determined, indicate a value of “unknown”.
