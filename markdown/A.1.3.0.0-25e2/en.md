A.1.3 Statements of responsibility

If  the  title  on  the  Manifestation  or  Item  includes  a  statement  of  responsibility,  the
name of a company, or a cast member, etc., do not include it as part of the title regard-
less of linguistic construction.

If the predominant form of the title in reference works includes a possessive state-
ment  of  responsibility  (e.g.,  “Il  Casanova  di  Federico  Fellini”/”Fellini’s  Casanova”),  the
cataloguer may include it as part of the title. In doubtful cases, do not include the pos-
sessive statement of responsibility as part of the title. In most cases the statement of
responsibility  or  name  was  not  intended  to  be  part  of  the  title,  but  was  included  for
publicity purposes. Create alternative titles for cases where, in the judgment of the cat-
aloguer, such titles would be helpful points of access.
