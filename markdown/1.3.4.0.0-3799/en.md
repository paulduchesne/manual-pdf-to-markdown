1.3.4 Year/Date of reference

A year or fuller date (e.g., day/month/year) is essential to identifying a moving image
Work and, where applicable, its Variants. A common use of year/date is chronological order-
ing of lists of Works and their Variants.54 As explained below, these guidelines recommend,
where possible, applying two qualifiers to a Date element: Date Type, and Date Precision.

There is no primary or “preferred” year or date except within the context of the type
of Work and, where applicable, its Variants. That is, typically, an original date of release
or  broadcast  is  essential  for  identifying  a  moving  image  Work  and  its  Variants.  In  the
absence of a release or broadcast date, provide a year of creation or production.

Record any dates associated with the Work or its Variants formatted according to ISO
8601  or  other  available  resources,  such  as  EDTF  (Extended  Date  Time  Format).  ISO  8601
prescribes  that  dates  should  be  formatted  hierarchically  as  Year-Month-Day,  using  this
convention: YYYY-MM-DD. Example: 2015-07-04. This structure eliminates confusion when
dates can be formatted with month before day or day before month (e.g., 07/04/2015 or
04/7/2015). Using the ISO format makes indexing and sorting more efficient. Using words
(June  11,  2004),  while  perhaps  user-friendly  in  its  narrative  construction,  are  difficult  to
index as dates. Mixing date formats causes confusion in data retrieval and for users!

Where full dates are not known use Year-Month YYYY-MM or just Year YYYY, as sys-

tems permit.
