1.2.1 Work/Variant Description Type41

The description type establishes the general focus of the Work being catalogued, wheth-
er  it  is  a  complete  Work  in  one  part,  a  Work  made  up  of  several  parts,  or  a  physical
group or collection of Works. Providing this information helps the cataloguer and user
understand  the  context  of  the  Work/Variant  being  described,  and  whether  it  has  any
relationships with other Works/Variants. For example, a television series could be cata-
logued as a Serial, which implies that there could be related Works (episodes) catalogued
as Monographs.

Record  the  level  of  description  of  the  work  being  catalogued,  for  example,  “analytic,”
“monographic,”  “serial,”  etc.,  according  to  a  controlled  vocabulary.  The  terms  used  in
this  Manual  are  derived  from  traditional  bibliographic  cataloguing  rules  and  from  EN
15907 (and are defined in Appendix D.1), but an institution may choose to create its own
list of terms. See D.1 Work/Variant Description Types.
