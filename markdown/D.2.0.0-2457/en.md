201  YCR, 2.1.1 Nature of modification (change in content) of expression



* A change in colour, which is a physical property, expresses a different Manifesta-
tion according to the data model this manual follows. However, it is recognised that in
practice, institutions who employ the Variant entity may consider changes to colour to
provoke the creation of a Variant because the colourisation of a black and white Work
represents a fundamental change to the visual aspects of the original Work.
