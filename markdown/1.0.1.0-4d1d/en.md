1.0.1 Moving Image Work

A moving image Work comprises both the intellectual or artistic content and the process
of realisation in a cinematographic medium, e.g., what it is called, when it was made,
who made it, who was in it, what it is about, etc.

A Work as a conceptual entity is the topmost level of description. It may be published
or unpublished, complete (whole) or incomplete (unfinished or missing content), edited
or unedited. It is intended to function as the “node” that relates all Variants and Man-
ifestations of a Work to a common creation. A Work contains the characteristics that
are inherited across any Variant, Manifestation, or Item derived from that Work. It also
reflects the original intentions of its realisation, including: circumstances of the creation
process such as date(s) and place(s) of production, most contributions by agents such
as directors, screenwriters, production companies and cast members, as well as certain
statements about the contents.25

The concept of moving image Work includes moving image realisations of events or per-
formances – such as edited or unedited recordings of a play or concert performed in a
theatre, a sporting event, a street performer, a medical procedure, etc.

In addition, moving images created by use of automatic devices such as surveillance
cameras  or  vehicle-mounted  cameras,  can  also  be  considered  moving  image  works  if
they are subject to collecting or publishing activities.

The presence of artistic intent in the creation of a moving image entity is not a pre-
requisite  for  considering  it  a  moving  image  Work.  A  moving  image  entity  can  be  con-
sidered as a Work on a very broad spectrum of creative intent, from the classic fiction
feature film at one extreme (with artistic input from dozens or hundreds of creative con-
tributors), through amateur film (with a modicum of creative intent by one individual), to
CCTV footage or other automatic recording outputs at the other extreme.

Works may have one-to-many relationships with instances of Variant and Manifes-
tation/Item and many-to-many relationships with instances of Agent(s,) Event(s), Con-
tent(s), Subject(s) and Other Relation(s).26
