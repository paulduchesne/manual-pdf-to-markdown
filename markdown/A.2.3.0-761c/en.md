Other  Work/Variant/Manifestation/Item  title  (WVMI)  information  is  defined  as  a  word  or
phrase appearing in conjunction with, and subordinate to the title, and which qualifies, ex-
plains, or completes the title to which it applies or which is indicative of the character, con-
tents, etc., of the WVMI, or the motives for, or occasion of, its production or publication.

Other title information includes subtitles, avant-titres, etc., but does not include alter-
native titles.140 Cataloguers may constitute subordinate phrases as part of the Work or Vari-

139  Adapted from FIAF, 1.4. Other title information, p. 25.
140  FIAF glossary and FIAF 1992, 1.4: “Other title information: a word or phrase, or a group of characters appear-
ing in conjunction with, and subordinate to, the title proper of the item. Other title information also occurs in
conjunction with and subordinate to: parallel titles, variations of the title proper, episode titles, contents titles,
titles of series, or of subseries. Other title information qualifies, explains or completes that title to which it ap-
plies, or is indicative of the character, contents, etc. of the item or the Works contained in it, or is indicative of
the motive for, or the occasion of, the item’s production. The term includes subtitles and avant-tîtres.”

Differently, in the RDA glossary and RDA 2.3.4: “Other title information is information that appears in conjunc-
tion with, and is subordinate to, the title proper of a resource. It may include any phrase appearing in conjunc-
tion with the title proper that is indicative of the character, content, etc. of the resource or the motives for, or
occasion of, its production of publication. Other title information includes subtitles, avant-titres, etc., but does
not include variations on the title proper such as spine titles, sleeve titles, etc. (see 2.3.6 ) or designations and/
or names of parts, sections, or supplements (see 2.3.1.7 ).”



ant title when, in their judgment, such phrases form an integral part of the preferred title.

If other title information appearing on the Manifestation/Item is considered to be im-
portant (either for identification or for access), transcribe it as it appears on the source
of  information,  following  the  principle  of  transcription  and  according  to  the  general
guidelines on transcription given in F.3 Relationship of FIAF Cataloguing Rules to Func-
tional Requirements of Bibliographic Records (FRBR), Resource Description and Access
(RDA) and The European Standards Committee (CEN) Cinematographic Works Standard
EN 15907, section entitled “Representation (or principle of transcription).

Distinguish the other title information through the use of spacing or punctuation, or
a separate or dedicated field. If a general material designation is used, place it after the
preferred title and before other title information.141

Claymation [motion picture]: three dimensional clay animation
This Britain [motion picture]: Heritage of the sea

A.2.3.1 Abridging or omitting other title information

If other title information is lengthy or of very minor importance, either give it in a note
or omit it. See Appendix B, Cataloguer’s Notes. Abridge other title information only if this
can be done without essential loss of information.142

If other title information is clearly of very minor importance, for example a newsreel
slogan, or it is an avant-titre which grammatically cannot follow the title proper, place
it in a note.143
