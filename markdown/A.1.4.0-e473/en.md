A.1.4 Possessives

Do not confuse possessive forms, or other grammatically related phrases, for state-
ments of responsibility with such phrases or forms, which are not statements of respon-
sibility, e.g., character names. Treat possessive forms as part of the title.

Examples:
Fatty’s wedding day
Eliza’s Romeo
Billy Bunter’s double
