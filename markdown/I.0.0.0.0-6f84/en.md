Appendix I, Examples of records con-
taining core elements in the different
levels of hierarchy

These include examples of  feature films, a documentary, a short fiction film, a home
movie, a television series and episode, and an aggregate television DVD and episode. It
is recognised that field names in different institutions’ systems will not necessarily use
identical terms to those of the core concepts or this manual (see 0.2 Core elements of
description).  Some  may  also  have  multiple  occurrences  and  multiple  fields  connected
with each element, whilst others may use few or no field names. Some institutions may
also have additional fields and data for in-house needs. The following examples reflect
some of these possible differences.
