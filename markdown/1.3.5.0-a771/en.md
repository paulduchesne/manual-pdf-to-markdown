1.3.5 Language(s)

A moving image Work is conceived and presented in a particular language or set of lan-
guages. Changes to the original language(s), as in the case of dubbing, are considered
minor changes and can constitute a Variant of a moving image Work.

Alternatively, such minor changes can constitute a new Manifestation of a moving im-
age  Work  rather  than  a  Variant.  Institutions  using  cataloguing  structures  that  do  not
distinguish Variant level information (for example, those that create records primarily at
the Manifestation level), should apply this alternative. (See guidelines for language in a
Manifestation: 2.3.3 Language)

Indicate the language(s) (e.g., Italian) and usage(s) (e.g., Italian intertitles) in which the
moving image Variant/Manifestation is written, spoken or sung, if applicable. More than
one language can occur in different forms, depending on how the content is expressed
(e.g., French dialogue and English subtitles).
