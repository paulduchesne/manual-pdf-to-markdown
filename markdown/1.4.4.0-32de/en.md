Record one or more “Other” relationship type terms to express the nature of the relation-
ship to the Work/Variant, choosing the most specific term possible from a controlled list of
values , for example, “based on,” “contained in,” etc. . A suggested list, which is open and
not exhaustive, can be found in Appendix D.17.1 Work/Variant Other Relationship Types.

Or, compose a term to describe the relationship between the Work being catalogued

and the related Work.

In a note, add any additional information concerning the relationship considered relevant.



Describe  or  demonstrate  Work-to-Work  relationships  through  linking  to  the  Work
identifier of the related Work, through the usage of relator terms, or according to the
confines of the institution’s data structure.

Remember,  a  Work  based  on  a  pre-existing  Work  should  be  identified  as  a  Variant
of the same Work unless it has been so significantly changed as to have become a new
related Work.83 See 1.1.1 Boundaries between Works and 1.1.2 Boundaries between Works
and Variants/Manifestations for determining when a Work should be identified as a new,
but related Work and when it should be identified as a Variant of the original Work.
