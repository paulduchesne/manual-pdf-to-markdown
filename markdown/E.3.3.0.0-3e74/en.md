E.3.3 Parallel Aggregates

Identical  moving  image  Works/Variants  but  in  different  languages  released  on  one

Manifestation.

Example:

Le declin de lâ€™empire American/The decline of the American Empire (1986)

A  publication  in  2004  by  Seville  Films  contains  three  language  versions;
French dialogue, English dubbed dialogue, English subtitles. There is com-
plete parallelism between the English and French Variants; each is equal in
duration and, except for the language, appear to be equivalent.

For Aggregate Manifestations record the length/duration of the whole, i.e. the total of all
the units/running times that constitute the Aggregate. In addition there is the option to
qualify this with details of the duration of each individual unit in either a Notes field, or
in multiple occurrences of the duration fields, depending on what systems used permit or
an institution decides. (See 2.3.5.2.1 Physical extent of an Aggregate Manifestation and
2.3.5.3.1 Duration of an Aggregate Manifestation)
