E.2.2 “Hybrid” Aggregates and multi-component
moving images (e.g. Anthology/Portmanteau fil-
ms or TV programmes)

Multi-component Works are ones conceived and created from their inception to con-
sist of multiple individual components that make up a whole, for example anthologies,
portmanteau films and television programmes (e.g., Dead of night, Quartet, From be-
yond the grave).

These should be treated as straightforward Monographic Works. (See 1. Moving Image

Works and Variants).

The different sections making up the whole were not independently created Works/
Variants with an existence in their own right outside the film. It was one film intention-
ally structured as a series of different stories, sometimes linked together by scenes and
characters, into one continual whole.

This is not the same as a later editing together of separate individual independent

Works/Variants with their own earlier individual Manifestations, e.g.

Portrait of a miner (Great Britain, 2002; BFI 2 disc DVD of various individual Na-
tional Coal Board short films).

Other  multi-component  moving  images  often  have  a  common  theme,  and  usually
comprise different shorts or elements made by different directors specifically as part of
that Work, e.g.,

Chacun son cinéma ou ce petit coup au cœur quand la lumière s’éteint et que le
film commence. (France, 2007): Compilation film of 33 three-minute films by var-
ious directors for the Cannes Film Festival’s 60th anniversary.

1’09”01 September 11 (France, Egypt, Great Britain, Mexico, USA, 2002): 11 short
films in which different directors give their impressions of the themes and events
of the date September 11 2001 and the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the
Pentagon.

Ro.Go.Pa.G. (Italy, France, 1963): 4 episodes by 4 different directors, no common
theme: R. Rossellini (Illibatezza), J.L. Godard (Il mondo nuovo), P. Pasolini (La ri-
cotta), U. Gregoretti (Il pollo ruspante).

New  York  stories  (1989):  3  episodes  by  3  different  directors,  common  theme.
Directors Woody Allen (Oedipus Wrecks), Francis Ford Coppol (Life without Zoe),
Martin Scorsese (Life lessons).

Tre passi nel delirio / Histoires extraordinaires (Italy-France, 1968): 3 episodes by 3
directors, common theme: L. Malle, (William Wilson), F. Fellini (Toby Dammit), R.
Vadim (Metzengerstein),



With these there was no original intention for the components to be independent223,
and there should always be a single Monographic Work record with a single Manifesta-
tion for them. The different component titles may be added as alternative titles to the
Work record to assist in retrieval or access, and/or details of individual component titles
and content given in the synopsis field on the Work. For example:

Aria (USA, UK, 1987)

Ten directors interpret various operatic arias:

On-screen titles [and sources] for segments (which are not numbered on-screen) are:

[1] Un ballo in maschera Nicolas Roeg/Un ballo in maschera [extracts from “Un
ballo in maschera” by Giuseppe Verdi]

[2] La vergine degli angeli Charles Sturridge/La forza del destino [“La vergine degli
angeli” from “La forza del destino” by Giuseppe Verdi]

[3]  Armide  Jean-Luc  Godard/Armide  [«Enfin  il  est  en  ma  puissance»  and  other
extracts from «Armide» by Jean-Baptiste Lully]

[4]  Rigoletto  Julien  Temple/Rigoletto  [“La  donna  è  mobile”  and  other  extracts
from “Rigoletto” by Giuseppe Verdi]….

Credits (i.e., Agents) for all the components should be attached to this single Work
record, following on-screen credits as far as possible but also including an indication of
which component they belong to where the on-screen credits may not be clear on this.
For example:

Each component title should not usually be created as a new Work, as this is not how
the  content  was  conceived  (i.e.,  it  was  designed  to  be  packaged  and  viewed  together
and is not separable) and none of them would then have any Manifestation record as an
individual Work. Those institutions that have the ability or desire to separate them out
to tie separate descriptions (e.g., credits) to each component part (i.e. representing the
parent-child relationship), may represent them as Analytic Works (see D.1 Work/Variant
Description Types).

Should  an  institution  acquire  some  or  all  of  the  components  on  different  physical
Items, then these should be linked to the Manifestation for the whole. In such cases it is
simply a matter of a partial/incomplete acquisition, in the same way that only 2 reels of
a 3 reel feature film might be acquired.

Intellectually these multi-component films are “hybrid” aggregates – they consist of
semi-independently created Works, i.e. each can be very different and made by different
directors and/or production companies – but they were always envisaged as forming a
whole  with  the  other  components;  although  some  or  even  all  may  sometimes  subse-
quently also be released as individual shorts.

To  use  a  music  analogy  they  are  rather  like  a  concept  album,  which  is  made  up  of
individual songs/tracks that may even have one or two released as singles, but they were
created  originally  as  part  of  a  larger  concept  or  unfolding  story  to  be  listened  to  and



appreciated as a whole; and which is different in nature to a “Best of..” or “Greatest Hits
…” compilation album.

Where an individual component does have a subsequent independent release, that
component should then also be created as a new Work/Variant in its own right, with its
own relevant Manifestation, and linked to the original multi-component Work in an as-
sociative “contains/contained in” relationship.

Toby  Dammit,  (episode  by  F.  Fellini  part  of  Tre  passi  nel  delirio  /  Histoires
extraordinaires,  Italy-France,  1968):  2008  restored  version  on  35mm  of  the
individual episode, with its own new Italian titles.

Where such individual releases of components have occurred, and a physical Item for
a component is acquired, assessment would then be needed to establish whether it was
a  partial  acquisition  Item  of  the  whole  original  Manifestation  or  an  acquisition  of  the
Item of the later individual component Manifestation.
