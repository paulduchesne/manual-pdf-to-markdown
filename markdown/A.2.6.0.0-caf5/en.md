A.2.6 Titles of series/serials

The guidelines and principles laid out in this section can be applicable across all the

categories of Works, Variants, Manifestations and Items (WVMI).

For monographic Works that are an episode within a series or serial169, and have their
own individual title, the individual episode title may be used as the preferred title for the
Work or Variant, or the title proper for the Manifestation and Item. However, the series/
serial title should also be indicated.

The series/serial title may be indicated within (i) the title field itself, or (ii) reflected
in a linked hierarchical relationship with an individual Serial Work level record, i.e. a Work
assigned the Description Type “Serial170; or (iii) added as a Title Type; or (iv) a combina-
tion. Individual institutions should select which is most appropriate for their own systems
and for clarity of identification and retrieval.

169  Serial = something which is a continuing story, for which it is necessary to have seen previous episodes to
follow the story line, e.g. Pride and Prejudice, The Black Arrow, Brideshead Revisited. Series = something which
contains programmes or episodes which are complete in themselves (although they may have characters in
common) for which it is not essential to have seen previous episodes in order to understand the story line/con-
tent, e.g. Cadfael. Midsomer Murders, World in Action.. BFI SIFT Inputting Manual.
170  See Appendix D.1 Work/Variant Description Types for EN 15907/BFI definitions of Serial as Description Type.



Example:

Work (Serial) – Mary Tyler Moore show

Work (Monographic) – Chuckles bites the dust

Manifestation – Chuckles bites the dust

Item – Chuckles bites the dust

OR

Work (Serial) – Mary Tyler Moore show

Work (Monographic) – Mary Tyler Moore show. Chuckles bites the dust

Manifestation – Mary Tyler Moore show. Chuckles bites the dust

Item – Mary Tyler Moore show. Chuckles bites the dust

OR

Work (Monographic) – Chuckles bites the dust (Preferred title)

Mary Tyler Moore show (Series title)

Manifestation – Chuckles bites the dust

Item – Chuckles bites the dust

A.2.6.1 Numbered episodes of a series/serial

With series/serials that contain episode or part numbers and individual episode titles
the same principles apply. The preferred title/title proper of the WVMI may incorporate
all these for clarity and retrieval purposes, or an institution’s systems may allow for use
of the episode title combined with separate specific Part field(s) for parts and numbers,
or both. Alternatively, an institution may choose to use one form for Work/Variants and
another for Manifestation and/or Items. With television series additional numbered sea-
son details may also be required as well as episode/part numbers.

Any or either of the forms may be used in combination as an institution chooses, al-
though this should be within the context of an institution establishing a clear standard
in-house practice rather than individual cataloguer preference and choice.171

It is worth bearing in mind that serials are always intended to be viewed in a specified
order. Therefore serial title, episode numbers, and episode titles are usually included on

171  The 1991 FIAF rules stipulated that such titles should have a comma separator between the part element
and individual title components of the Title, e.g., Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars, Chapter 12, Ming the Merciless.
However, the trend seems to be to distinguish the different elements of such component types of titles with a
full stop separator, e.g., Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars. Chapter 12. Ming the Merciless.



the Item itself or in secondary sources, and should be reflected in the record to aid in
discovery and identification.

Example: Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars. Chapter 12. Ming the Merciless

Work (Serial) – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars

Work (Monographic) – Ming the Merciless

Manifestation – Ming the Merciless

Item – Ming the Merciless

[with “Chapter 12” element being added to a separate relevant Part field]

OR

Work (Serial) – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars

Work (Monographic) – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars. Chapter 12. Ming the Mer-
ciless

Manifestation – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars. Chapter 12. Ming the Merciless

Item – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars. Chapter 12. Ming the Merciless

OR

Work (Serial) – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars

Work (Monographic) – Ming the Merciless

Manifestation – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars. Chapter 12. Ming the Merciless

Item – Flash Gordon’s trip to Mars. Chapter 12. Ming the Merciless

The same principle can be applied to episodes of a series/serial that do not have their
own individual titles but have numbered parts.

Example:

Work (Serial) – Pride and prejudice

Work (Monographic) – Pride and prejudice. Part One

Manifestation – Pride and prejudice. Part One

Item – Pride and prejudice. Part One

Reflect the Part term used in any source of information, for example, “part,” “chapter,”



“episode,” etc. Equally, if the number is in numerals then use those, and if alphabetical,
i.e. One, Two, Three, etc., use those.

A.2.6.2 Episodes of a series/serial with no individual title
or numbered parts

For episodes of a series/serial that have neither individual episode titles nor numbered
parts, a date can be added to the title field, with the option of utilising square brackets
for  clarity.  It  is  recommended  to  use  the  release/production/transmission  date  of  the
Manifestation to which the Item or Work/Variant pertains.

If  a  repeat  broadcast  of  a  television  programme  with  no  individual  title  or  numbered
parts has been acquired, then a new Manifestation and Item should be created with the
repeat  broadcast  date  appended  to  their  titles.  Within  the  hierarchical  structure  this
new Manifestation would link to the Work that may incorporate an earlier original broad-
cast date within its preferred title.

The new Manifestation/Item title could be added to the Work level as an Alternative title
type.

Example:

Work (Serial) – Panorama

Work (Monographic) – Panorama [2011-01-23]

Manifestation 1 – Panorama [2011-01-23]

Item – Panorama [2011-01-23]

Manifestation 2 – Panorama [2011-05-03]

Item – Panorama [2011-05-03]

In the above example the Manifestations “Panorama [2011-01-23] and “Panorama [2011-
05-03]” both link hierarchically to the same Work, entitled “Panorama [2011-01-23]” as
they are broadcasts on different dates of exactly the same programme.

Alternatively, the cataloguer can supply the type of unit and number, with the option of
utilising square brackets for clarity.

Example:

Work (Serial) – Panorama

Work (Monographic) – Panorama. [Episode 1]

Manifestation – Panorama. [Episode 1]



Item – Panorama. [Episode 1]

Manifestation – Panorama. [Episode 1] (repeat broadcast)

Item – Panorama. [Episode 1] (repeat broadcast)

In the above example, the Manifestations with different broadcast dates both
link hierarchically to the same Work. The original broadcast date can be entered
in the Date field for the Work, and the repeat broadcast date can be entered in
a Date field for the Manifestation/Item, should one exist, or in a Notes field for
the Manifestation/Item.

A.2.6.3 Analytics/Components of identified newsreels/
cinemagazines

Where a complete newsreel issue has been acquired and the newsreel series has been
identified, then titling follows the same principles and guidelines above.

Newsreels  and  cinemagazines  can  often  be  acquired  as  incomplete.  The  incomplete
Items acquired may have a different title than the Manifestation and Work to which they
are related. Such Items should be linked to a Work/Manifestation reflecting the whole
issue, (see “British Paramount News” examples given below).

Newsreels and cinemagazines172 usually consisted of several separate reports that were
all analytics/components of a particular issue, and also usually had inter-title headings
within the newsreel itself.

If an institution acquires only a part of a newsreel issue, then any inter-title heading that
is on the acquired print may be used as the title of the Item, particularly in cases where
the title of the newsreel issue as a whole (i.e. the Work/Manifestation) is unknown.

For example, British Paramount news No. 856 contains the inter-titled headed segments
President  Roosevelt  opens  World  Fair;  70th  birthday  of  US  coast  to  coast  railway;  and,
Princesses play with baby pandas.

Should an institution only acquire a reel of the segment President Roosevelt opens World
Fair, then this can be designated as the title of the Item.

Where it is known with which particular newsreel issue or series the acquired segment
belongs then there is also the option to incorporate the newsreel series/issue title within
the title assigned to the segment, for example:

British Paramount news No. 856. President Roosevelt opens World Fair

OR

172  BFI definitions: Newsreels = Films dating from 1910 to 1979, which report on local and international events
and which were regularly screened at cinemas, e.g. Pathé News 1910-1970; Warwick Bioscope Chronicle 1910-
1915; Topical Budget 1911-1931; Newsreel Flying Machine Compilation 1910. Cinemagazines = Short magazine film
including more than two interest items, e.g. Aussie Oddities (1948), This Week in Britain (1950-1980)



British Paramount news. President Roosevelt opens World Fair

Within a hierarchical structure, the Item President Roosevelt opens World Fair would be
linked as “part of” the Theatrical Manifestation British Paramount news No. 856, i.e. the
whole newsreel issue, which in turn would be linked to the Work record for the whole issue
also with the title British Paramount news No. 856.

Example:

Work (Series) – British Paramount news

Work (Monographic) – British Paramount news. No. 856

Manifestation – British Paramount news. No. 856

Item – President Roosevelt opens World Fair

OR

Work (Series) – British Paramount news

Work (Monographic) – British Paramount news. No. 856

Manifestation – British Paramount news. No. 856

Item – British Paramount news. No. 856. President Roosevelt

opens World Fair

At the Work level each of the titled analytics/components making up the whole, i.e. the
separate news reports, can be added as additional alternative titles.

Alternatively, the component titles can be listed in a Summary or Description field for
the Work.

Should the Item acquired incorporate more than one inter-titled component, for exam-
ple only reel 2 of a 2 reel Item is acquired that includes both 70th birthday of US coast to
coast railway and Princesses play with baby pandas, then a different approach may be
taken. This would involve using the title of the appropriate Manifestation pertaining to
the whole newsreel issue and adding qualifying details, optionally in square brackets, as
a second element of the title to create a title for the Item, for example

British Paramount news No. 856. [Reel 2]

OR

British Paramount news No.856. Reel 2



British Paramount news No.856. [Incomplete]

OR

British Paramount news No.856. Incomplete

with any inter-title designations on the print then added as alternative type titles, for
example:

Preferred Title: British Paramount news No. 856. [Reel 2]

Alternative Title : 70th birthday of US coast to coast railway

Alternative Title : Princesses play with baby pandas

If deemed necessary or helpful for the purposes of discovery, the alternative titles added
to Items should also be added to the Work level record.

Alternatively, the titles of each analytic/component may be included in a notes and/or
contents field.

Square  brackets  may  be  used  within  titles  for  encasing  necessary  extra  qualifying  or
clarification elements that are not on the actual print.

A.2.6.4 Analytics/components of unidentified news-
reels/ cinemagazines

Where only an analytic/component of a copy pertaining to a whole Work has been
acquired as an Item, and the Serial Work to which it belongs is unable to be identified
(i.e., the Item acquired is clearly a section of newsreel but the newsreel series has not
been identified), then the title assigned to that Item should also be used to create the
title for the Manifestation and Work records, which will then be related to each other
hierarchically.

The  Item  title  is  assigned  in  accordance  with  3.1.2  Title  and  A.2.5  Supplied/Devised

Titles.

The following paragraphs relate to Archive systems that are using the CEN structure:

Work level titles created in this way would be described as having the CEN attribute
of “Analytic” and indication that the title is a supplied/devised title type. Further clari-
fications could then be put into synopsis/description or notes fields areas of the Work.

Should the whole Work of which the Item is a part subsequently be identified, then
the Analytic record can be either modified or deleted and the Item linked via a “part of”
relationship to a whole issue Theatrical Manifestation, which is in turn “part of” a whole
Work, or Monographic Work.173

173  See Appendix D, Value Lists for CEN categories and definitions used by BFI



A.2.6.5 Fragments/segments of unidentified moving im-
ages (film or television programmes)

Similar principles apply to any unidentified and incomplete segments or fragments of

films or television programmes that have been acquired.

For example, a reel of a silent fiction film with no title given on either the print or can,
or any indication of what it is, other than it is clearly part of a longer film, should be as-
signed a relevant Item title in accordance with the guidelines in A.2.5 Supplied/Devised
Titles, for example:

Unidentified silent film segment

or where possible following the who/what/where/when ordering principles in creating
a devised title.174

Medieval battle segment. Unidentified silent film

OR

Unidentified silent film. Medieval battle segment

The Item title would then be utilised to create the Manifestation and Work level re-

cords as well.

In such cases the Work would be assigned the attribute Monographic. Analytic is only

used for a whole component rather than a fragment of a whole.

Square brackets around a whole devised title are optional, as this can alternatively be
inferred by use of a Supplied/Devised Title Type designation. Many electronic systems can
be punctuation sensitive, so presence of square brackets [], particularly at the start of a
title, could impact on searchability.
