F.3.1.2 Definitions of the “Work” and ”Variant”
Entities

The FIAF Cataloguing and Documentation Commission has chosen to model this man-
ual on definitions of “Work” and “Variant” adopted by the European Standards Commit-
tee, rather than the FRBR and RDA definitions of “Work” and “Expression,” to make these
concepts more practical for describing moving images. FRBR and RDA consider “works”
and  “expressions”  to  be  abstract  entities  that  only  acquire  physical  characteristics  at
the “manifestation or “item” level. However, moving image “works” are more easily con-
ceptualized  as  concrete  entities.  This  is  because  a  moving  image  work  only  becomes
such through a complex process involving multiple contributors. This process results in a
“fixed” or “expressed” object (whether analogue or digital) that typically combines a vi-
sual part (the moving image), and a textual part (the soundtrack or intertitles).231 There-

231  Yee. “The Concept of Work for Moving Image Materials, p. 33.



fore, the concept of a moving image work comprises both the content and the process of
realisation in a moving image medium.232

Further, this manual continues to follow the precepts already outlined in Film Cata-
loguing and FIAF Cataloguing Rules for Film Archives by including the concept of “origi-
nal.” The FIAF Cataloguing Rules for Film Archives recommend using the “original release
title or broadcast title in the country of origin, i.e., the country of the principal offices
of the production company or individual by whom the moving image work was made”233
to identify a Work. “Owing to the complex interrelationships of persons and corporate
bodies in the creation of a moving image work, the original release or broadcast title is
chosen as the single element which can provide the level of consistency and standardi-
sation requisite for any national and international networking or sharing of cataloguing
data.”234

Likewise, the “original” defined here contains characteristics that persist across any
variation or output of a moving image work and that reflect the original intentions of its
realisation, including: circumstances of the creation process such as date(s) and place(s)
of production, most contributions by agents such as directors, screenwriters, production
companies and cast members, as well as certain statements about the contents.235

In this way, a moving image work as a concept is closer to a combining of FRBR and
RDA’s work and expression entities. This definition also aligns closely with the concept
of “work primary expression” formulated by the Online Audiovisual Catalogers (OLAC)
Cataloging Policy Committee (CAPC) Moving Image Work-Level Records Task Force and
the CEN’s EN 15907. A primary difference here is that EN 15907 specifies for the concept
of “original” to be expressed in association with an instance of a Manifestation that em-
bodies the original Work.

The use of the term “variant” is not a mere substitute for the term “expression.” In
the context of moving images, variants and expressions cannot be considered equiva-
lent concepts because moving image works are already their own expressions.236 As ex-
plained above, a moving image work has by definition taken a form (been expressed) and
contains specific attributes that correspond to the concept of an “original” or “primary
expression.” The variants correspond to all other “expressions.” For example, a colorized
version  of  The  asphalt  jungle  (1950)  does  not  express  the  original  work;  it  contains  a
variation  from  the  original  idea  conceived  by  John  Huston  and  put  into  form.  If  there
is  no  variation  from  the  work  as  originally  conceived,  there  is  no  “variant,”  but  under
FRBR there would always be an “expression.” This exemplifies why these concepts are not
equal: that is, there may not always be a variant but there must always be an expres-
sion.237
