3.3.1 Agent(s)

An Agent for moving image Items is defined as an entity that is involved in the ac-
quisition, movement (for loans, inspection, storage, etc.), or preservation of a moving
image Item and who is considered to have major responsibility for, or be of major impor-
tance to, the moving image Item. Typical distinctions between Agent types are Person,
Corporate Body, Family and Person Group.121

Agent(s) may also have relationships to an instance of a specific Event or of an “Other”

relationship in connection with the Item.

Because responsibility for moving image materials is most often complex and highly
diverse,  institutions  -  particularly  those  with  special  interests  -  should  determine  the
types of functions they wish to include in this area. These functions may vary from insti-
tution to institution according to the types of moving image material held.

3.3.1.1 Agent Activity

Describes the activity of the Agent to make explicit the relationship(s) between the

Agent and the Item.

Record one or more Agent activity terms, for example, “preservationist,” “curator,”
“acquisition source”, etc., to express the nature of the Agent’s relationship to the Item.
Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms.

Choose the single most specific term, if possible. If no suggested terms apply, com-
pose  a  term  to  describe  the  relationship  between  the  Agent  and  the  Item.  If  the  rela-
tionship is ambiguous, use a value to indicate this, for example, “unknown.” Optionally,
when the role performed by an Agent is probable but not certain, provide the function
name followed by a question mark, or by a qualifying note.

Besides the principal Agent Activities suggested, institutions, particularly those with
special  interests,  should  create  and  apply  in-house  value  lists  of  other  specific  Agent
activities, which may vary from institution to institution.

Record in a note any additional details that cannot be expressed through controlled
terms. If a name is known to be fictitious, or requires clarification, make a note giving
the actual name, etc.

For recording the attributes of Agents (e.g. first name, last name, nationality, etc.),
refer to authoritative sources such as Functional requirements for authority data: a con-
ceptual model or tools such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File.122 Optionally,
if the Agent is credited under a name that is not identical with the preferred name from
an authority file, record the name as used in the current instance of the related entity.123

Provide access to the Agent(s) and Agent Activity in the terms and language in which
they appear, either in the sources of information or in the language of the institution, or
both. If more than one Agent is associated with a particular role connected with an Item or
Event, where possible or desirable, record the names in the order indicated by the sequence,
layout, or typography of the names on the source of information. Preserving the ordering of
the credited persons should be determined by the requirements of individual institutions.124
