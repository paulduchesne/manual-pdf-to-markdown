2.1.1 Changes in the publication context

If  the  embodiment  of  a  Work/Variant  involves  contextual  changes,  related  to  the
publication  or  release  process,  the  resulting  product  is  a  new  Manifestation,  e.g.,  a
change from theatrical release to home video distribution.

In this case, create a new Manifestation and characterise it according to a controlled list.
A suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found at D.5 Manifestation Types
