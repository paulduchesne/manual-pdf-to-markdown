D.4.2 Award(s) or Nomination(s)205

The bestowal of an award relating to the Work/Variant or Manifestation. This excludes
awards for Agents alone (e.g. “for lifetime achievement”), but includes awards for individ-
ual achievements within the context of a Work or Variant (e.g. “Best screenplay”). Awards
will usually be associated at the level of the Work, except for cases where features of a
particular Variant are explicitly mentioned (e.g. “Best audio commentary for the visually
impaired”) or the award relates to a particular Manifestation (such as a DVD edition).

An Award(s) or Nomination(s) Event may be associated with instances of Agent in the
role of e.g. publisher, distributor, broadcaster206, etc. See D.8 Manifestation Agent Types
and D.3 Work/Variant Agent Types. If the award was given for the achievement of a spe-
cific Agent within the context of the Work/Variant or Manifestation, identify the Agent.
Also used to identify Agents that have sponsored the award.

An Award(s) or Nomination(s) Event may be associated with instances of other Events

during which award winners were selected (e.g. film festival).

festation” for this data.



•	 Nomination only

ation of it) was nominated but not among the winners. This element can be realised
in a system as a “flag.” If there was only a nomination, this element would be set to
a logical value of “true.”

•	 Award name

The name of the award or trophy, possibly including a numeric designation (e.g. 2nd Prize)

•	 Achievement

A phrase describing a specific achievement for which the award was given, if not for
the Work, Variant or Manifestation in total.
