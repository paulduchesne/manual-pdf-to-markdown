A.2.1 Identifying (i.e. Uniform or Display)132

A title that differentiates Works or Variants and which is designed for identification and
differentiation purposes in display, i.e. the title which displays in search results.133

An identifying title is designed to identify the entity it represents quickly and concisely to
as many users as possible, including users both familiar and unfamiliar with the entity be-
ing identified. This type of title will not be necessary in all systems, such as those utilising
unique identifiers (e.g., ISAN or EIDR), or those that index other distinguishing elements in
separate fields that will display with the title in search results, e.g., Year of reference. In
those cases the Identifying and Preferred title will often be one and the same.

Where separate fields do not exist, create an identifying title using the preferred title
of the Work/Variant as the starting point (if no title, see A.2.5.1 Partially Supplied/De-
vised Titles).134

Add whatever additions to the title are necessary to identify the Work/Variant and
distinguish it from other Works/Variants with the same title.135 These types of additions
are traditionally made within the title field itself (in parentheses or brackets) although
other  punctuation  separators,  e.g.  full  stop  may  also  be  used.  Use  multiple  additions
where necessary. If multiple additions must be made to the title field in order to identify
the Work/Variant, distinguish each addition (e.g., through the use of punctuation such
as space colon space, or space full stop space).

For example:

Blade runner. Final Cut. 1982

Possible qualifiers include content terms (see for example D.18 List of form terms for
Supplied/Devised  titles),  corporate  bodies  that  are  not  principal  creators  of  the  Work/
Variant but are closely associated with the Work/Variant and useful for identification of
it, place of publication/release/distribution/broadcast, and date of publication/release/
distribution/ broadcast.136

Example:

Works

A Star is born (Motion picture : 1954)

A Star is born (Television programme : 1961)

132  Term “Identifying title” corresponds with EN 15907. This is the equivalent of “Uniform title” in FRBR and
“Preferred title” in RDA.

134  Both YCR (0.9.3 Normalized human-readable identifiers or headings) and EN 15907 (6.4 Identifying Title)
recommend the construction of a human-readable identifier for result list displays, with disambiguation using
data such as Genre, Year, etc.

Variants

Police story III – Supercop. English subtitled version

Blade runner (Motion picture. 1982. 2007 version)

Blade runner (Motion picture. 1987. 25th anniversary edition)

It  is  not  necessary  to  append  Variant  information  to  the  Work  identifying  title  for
every type of Variant; many of the types of modifications that lead to Variants are too
complex to include and much of the data that identifies a particular Variant will consist
of data elements that form part of the Variant description.
