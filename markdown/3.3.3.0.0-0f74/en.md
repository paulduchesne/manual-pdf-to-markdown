Item(s) associated with the moving image Item

It is possible for a moving image Item to have a horizontal relationship with another Item
as a related object. Such associative relationships are more prevalent and varied at the
Work level, but there are instances where Items need to be related, for example, where
an institution has separate Items for Yellow, Cyan and Magenta Separation Negatives,
each of which have to be combined in Technicolor Three Colour Strip Process to make a
new colour print. Or, hold separate sound and image Items that would both be needed to
make a new print. Similarly, in the case of restorations where separate Items or elements
have been used to create a new restored Item.

Record one or more “Other” relationship type terms to express the nature of the rela-
tionship to the Item, choosing the most specific term possible from existing relator terms
lists, for example, “accompanied by,” “contained in,” etc. Selection should be made from
a  controlled  list  of  values.  A  suggested  list,  which  is  open  and  not  exhaustive,  can  be
found in D.17.3 Item Other Relationship Types.

In a note, add any additional information concerning the relationship considered relevant.

If the cataloguing system allows, attach a digital file that reproduces any associated

“document”.
