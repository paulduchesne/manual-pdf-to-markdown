1.3.2 Title

Record at least one title, identifying phrase, or name for the moving image Work or Vari-
ant. If your institution is applying the use of “Type” qualifiers, use “Title Type” to state the
function of a particular title. (see 1.3.2.1 Title Type and Appendix A, Titles and Title Types).

Ideally, the record should at a minimum contain the “preferred title” (also referred
to as “main” or “original” title) of the Work or Variant. Generally, it is the title of a mov-
ing image Work or Variant when first released, broadcast, published or transmitted (i.e.
mounted online) in the country or countries of origin. It may differ from the title found
on a particular manifestation of the Work or Variant; the actual title on the Manifesta-
tion is noted in the Manifestation Title element (see 2.3.2 Title). See A.2.0 Preferred for
additional information.

46  Pietro Fosco is the pseudonym of Giovanni Pastrone used in the ISAN registration.





For creating titles for untitled or unidentified entities see A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles.
Television programmes and other types of content that are part of a series/serial should
have both the series/serial title and the episode title included in the Work record. This may
be via use of a “Title type” qualifier. See A.2.6 Titles of series/serials for other options
