F.3.1.4. Boundaries between entities

The traditional practice within moving image archives of incorporating variation in-
formation  into  a  record  enabled  this  one  record  to  carry  within  it  all  the  details  rela-
tive  to  the  differing  components  of  a  whole.239  Within  the  framework  of  the  FRBR  and
RDA  models,  and  the  EN  15907  schema,  the  work  record  represents  this  “one  record,”
incorporating certain descriptive details, but the placement of the variation information
changes.  Different  editions,  versions,  or  variations  are  represented  by  the  variant  and
manifestation entities, and the differences are recorded at the appropriate level or on
the particular entity record, or designated in some way as belonging to the specific enti-
ty. The treatment of an “information resource” by using the four-tier hierarchy to express
the concept allows it to be described and viewed at each of the four levels: for example,
a  documentary  is,  simultaneously,  a  particular  copy  or  component  pieces  (item(s)),  a
particular  publication  (manifestation),  a  particular  edition  (variant),  and  a  particular
piece of work (work).

It  remains  essential  to  users  of  archival  moving  image  material  that  information  de-
scribing  the  original  work  and  information  describing  the  item  in  hand  are  presented
in a manner that clearly delineates this relationship. The relationship in library terms is
described as the concept of “edition” and it includes any changes in content or changes
in carrier. Separate editions of printed library material are catalogued separately, and
usually  no  attempt  is  made  to  determine  whether  edition  statements  always  indicate
major changes in content.240 “Publication,” in the context of a moving image archive, is
used interchangeably with “distribution” and means “making the resource available.”241
For  moving  image  materials,  the  terms  most  analogous  to  this  concept  of  edition  are

“versions with major changes” and “variations with minor changes.”242 (see http://www.

In moving image archives, both the occurrence of a change in the content and the
extent  of  the  change  are  important.  In  most  cases,  for  moving  image  materials,  the
changes in content are a function of some form of editing.

The treatment of the concepts of “versions with major changes” and “variations with
minor changes” in this revision shift to a focus on changes in content and changes to
carrier and correlate to the boundaries between the variants (changes in content) of a
work and its manifestations (changes in carrier). This does not replace the need to create
a version with major changes as a new Work where this is necessary and appropriate 1.1.2
