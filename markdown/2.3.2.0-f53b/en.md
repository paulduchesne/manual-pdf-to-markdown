2.3.2 Title

Record at least one title, identifying phrase, or name for the Manifestation Title. This
is a transcribed element, reflecting the actual title as it appears on screen. The original
release title would be added under the Work/Variant Title field.

If multiple titles are recorded, where allowable, associate a “Title Type” to a title for
differentiation between the various types of titles (see 2.3.2.1 Title Type and A.2 Title Types).

87  The V-ISAN represents the third segment of the ISAN number, which consists of a 96-bits number structured
as follows: the first is the root, which identifies the work, the second is the episode section, which identifies the
part within a multi-part work, the third is the so-called version section, which identifies variants and Manifesta-
tions (particularly as far as format changes and “media embodiments”, such as Blu-Ray, digital files, tapes, etc..,
are concerned): see http://www.isan.org/docs/isan_user_guide.pdf, Version 2.2.2. February 2012, 13/49.

The title of a Manifestation can sometimes differ, either slightly or wholly from the
title of the Variant or Work to which it is linked. This may be the case, for example, with
the acquisition of an incomplete Manifestation lacking a title or with a title added by the
source of the acquisition.
