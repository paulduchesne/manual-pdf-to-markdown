H.1 Rights in a moving image Work

The intellectual property rights in a moving image work are known by various terms
such  as  Copyright,  Ayant  droit,  Droit  d’Auteur,  IP  or  simply  Rights.  These  IP  rights  are
complex entities, reflecting the complexity of a moving image work’s creation; and they
vary across legal frameworks and across historical periods. It is therefore impractical to
define a minimum cataloguing requirement which is compliant across all territories and
periods. In addition, it should be noted that legal frameworks can change across time,
so data which is not useful today can become useful if the legal definition changes – for
example the definitions of author outlined below.

With that context in mind, the following attempts to define a good practice set of
properties which the moving image cataloguer should consider, both in reference to their
specific legal framework, and in reference to potentially useful data over the lifecycle of
the archive’s activity. In short: capturing more of the core rights data now will safeguard
future archival activity better than capturing less of that rights data now.

It is important to note that intellectual property rights in a moving image work are
created automatically, regardless of any requirement for formal registration by the cre-
ators  of  the  work.  In  addition,  it  is  worth  noting  that  in  some  legal  territories,  unlike
literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, moving image works do not have to meet
the  criterion  of  ‘original’  to  be  protected  with  intellectual  property  rights.  Finally,  it  is
worth noting that unpublished works are often treated differently under law to published
works, so it is recommended that the cataloguer capture a statement where it is known
that a work is unpublished (for example, home movies).

The recommended properties below are preceded by some background information.
