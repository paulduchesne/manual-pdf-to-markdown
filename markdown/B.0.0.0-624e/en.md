Appendix B, Cataloguer’s Notes

A cataloguer’s note is any annotation that might be helpful to those using or revising
the  cataloguing  data.  It  includes  information  that  does  not  readily  fit  into  dedicated
fields or other areas of the description. The extent and specificity of notes will depend
upon factors such as staff, viewing facilities, documentation, system designs, etc.178

Take information recorded in notes from any suitable source. When creating the note,
apply the guidelines in Chapter 0. Preliminary Notes on capitalisation, quotations, ref-
erences, etc.

Institutions may establish more rigorous, local guidelines as to the order of informa-
tion in the notes area. For example, when recording notes which further describe data
elements already catalogued, some institutions may stipulate the order of notes follow
a particular sequence wherever possible, e.g., title, statement of responsibility, edition/
version/variation, production, distribution, etc.; or, when uniformity of presentation as-
sists in the recognition of the type of information being presented or gives economy of
space without loss of clarity.179
