0.4.1 Punctuation

These guidelines do not mandate the use of any particular data presentation stan-
dard, such as ISBD punctuation. However, ISBD punctuation is recommended if punctu-
ation guidance is desired. Please consult ISBD20 for general guidance and examples, or
the FIAF Cataloguing Rules for Film Archives (1991)21.

These  guidelines  do  advocate  consistent  usage  where  punctuation  is  needed  as  a
cataloguing  construction,  for  example,  to  separate  Form  elements  in  the  creation  of
Partially or Fully Supplied/Devised Titles e.g.

Jaws. Rushes

For transcribed elements, record punctuation as found. For all other elements, record

punctuation as found on the source(s) of information.
