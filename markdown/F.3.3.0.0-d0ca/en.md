F.3.3 User Tasks

FRBR and RDA have defined and adopted the following tasks reflecting the traditional
core functions of the catalogue:244

find—i.e., to find resources that correspond to the user’s stated search criteria

identify—i.e., to confirm that the resource described corresponds to the resource sought,
or to distinguish between two or more resources with similar characteristics

select—i.e., to select a resource that is appropriate to the user’s needs

242  FIAF, 1991, p. xii-xiii. They are defined as following in the 1991 rules:
Versions with major changes. If the cataloging agency has determined that the item in hand differs signifi-
cantly from the original work, i.e., major editing has been done, the item is described in a separate cataloging
record. The item in hand is designated a version of the original work with major changes, e.g., short version,
classroom version, etc., and the distribution information for the separate version is recorded. The relationship
to the original work is indicated in the edition/version statement, and, in most instances, in a note. Distribution
information relating to the original work may also be indicated in a note.
Variations with minor changes. When the cataloging agency determines that an item, although designated as
being re-edited, e.g., a “new edition,” has not indeed been changed significantly, it may express this relation-
ship by recording the statement of responsibility for the original in area one, the variation and statement of
responsibility for the variation in area two, and the production, distribution information for both the original
and variation copies in area three. Multiple edition/version/variation statements may be given when cataloging
multiple variations with minor changes.

obtain—i.e., to acquire or access the resource described.

RDA added an additional set of user tasks based on those defined in IFLA’s Working Group
on  Functional  Requirements  and  Numbering  of  Authority  Records  (FRANAR),  and  de-
scribe an entity associated with a resource:

find—i.e., to find information on that entity and on resources associated with the entity

identify—i.e., to confirm that the entity described corresponds to the entity sought, or to
distinguish between two or more entities with similar names, etc.

clarify—i.e., to clarify the relationship between two or more such entities, or to clarify
the relationship between the entity described and a name by which that entity is known

understand—i.e., to understand why a particular name or title, or form of name or title,
has been chosen as the preferred name or title for the entity.

These user tasks are listed because they are pertinent to moving image cataloguing and
can be adapted to cover many of the search and discovery needs of those who might
seek  moving  images.  For  example,  Martha  Yee  (2007)  provides  one  adaptation  of  the
functions of the library catalogue for moving images:

To find, identify, select, and acquire: 245

•	 All the versions (Variants) of a sought Work (for example the various “direc-

tor’s cuts” of Blade runner as well as the original release version), specified by
its title, or by its title in conjunction with the name of one of its creators or by
date, that are held by your collection or to which you license access.

•	 All the copies (Manifestations or Items) of a particular version (Variant) of a
Work (for example, all the copies you hold of the studio’s director’s cut) that
are held by your collection or to which you license access.

•	 All the Works of a particular person (for example, director, actor, costume
designer) or corporate body (for example, studio) that are held by your col-
lection or to which you license access.

•	 All the Works on a subject (for example, the Vietnam War) that are held by

your collection or to which you license access.

•	 All the Works in a particular form or genre (for example, animation, gangster

films) that are held by your collection or to which you license access.

Representation (or, principle of transcription)

The  basic  principle  of  transcription  is  an  area  in  which  archival  moving  image  cat-
aloguing  frequently  deviates  from  traditional  library  cataloguing.  Whereas  traditional
library cataloguers typically transcribe descriptive data directly from the physical item,
this is not always the case in archival moving image cataloguing. Because of this, earlier
moving  image  cataloguing  rules  and  standards  (FIAF,  AMIM)  have  suggested  the  term

245  Yee, 2007, p. 16.



“preferred” rather than “chief” source of filmographic information for representing mov-
ing images. The importance of reflecting the original details of a moving image work is
a  primary  principle  of  organisation  for  moving  image  archives.  This  underlies  another
practice  of  moving  image  cataloguing,  which  was  also  recommended  in  the  1991  FIAF
Rules, namely choosing the original release title in country of origin as the preferred title
for a work. Other titles (e.g., translated titles, re-release or reissue titles, titles on the
item  or  accompanying  material,  etc.),  are  recorded  at  the  appropriate  entity  level,  or
designated as belonging to the appropriate entity, and linking mechanisms from other
titles to the original release title should be utilised.

Because, however, it is not always possible for a cataloguer to determine an original
release  title,  guidelines  are  also  provided  for  choice  of  the  preferred  title  of  the  work
when either: 1) the concept of original release title is not applicable (as in the case of
unedited footage), or when 2) a cataloguer is unable, through research, to determine the
original release title.

Rights Information

Because national and international rights regulations for moving image materials gov-
ern not only the copying of materials for subsequent use, but also the screening and/or
viewing of such materials, information concerning rights is considered of paramount im-
portance to most moving image archives. These guidelines include a separate area for the
recording of information about the rights status of moving image materials for the entities
that  make  up  a  moving  image  resource.  The  guidelines  include  provisions  for  recording
both original and current rights information, as well as for indicating when the cataloguer
has not been able to find any information. Since rights issues are complex legal matters,
some moving image archives prefer to maintain separate legal files, or sometimes even to
leave the resolution of rights issues entirely to the responsibility of the user or client. For
these reasons, the recording of rights information has been designated “optional.” For a
more  extensive  and  expanded  further  exploration  of  rights  and  potential  rights  data  to
capture, see Appendix H, Rights/Copyright/IPR Registration.
