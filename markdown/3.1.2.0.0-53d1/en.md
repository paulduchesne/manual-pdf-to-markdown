113  EN 15907, “Inventory number,” p. 12



If multiple titles are recorded, where allowable, associate a “Title Type” to a title for

differentiation between the various types of titles (see A.2 Title Types).

In most cases the title of an Item will be the same as that of the Manifestation to

which it pertains.

The title of an Item can sometimes differ, either slightly or wholly from the title of
the Manifestation, and/or Work/Variant to which it is linked. In particular, this may be
the case where an incomplete physical product of the Manifestation has been acquired.
For example, if a film in the collection is missing the first reel where opening title credits
usually appear, the Item will not have a title to be transcribed.

For creating titles for untitled or unidentified entities see A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles

For the treatment of Aggregates (e.g. compilations of whole Manifestations) as ap-

plied to Items, see Appendix E.4 Titling of Aggregates for titling of Aggregates.

For guidance on wording, order, spelling, punctuation, accentuation and capitalisa-

tion, see Chapter 0. Preliminary Notes.

For sources of information for the Title, see Section 0.3 Sources of Information.
