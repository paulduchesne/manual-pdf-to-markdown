0.1.2 Scope

The  manual  is  designed  for  use  by  institutions  with  moving  image  collections  and
cataloguers of moving images as a guide in the preparation of cataloguing records or de-
scriptive metadata. The recommendations apply to generalised film and television col-
lections, and may require elaboration in more specialised institutions whose holdings are
exclusively of a single format or type, e.g., commercials, newsfilm, television, unedited
footage, etc. For example, those with television collections should additionally consider
more specific standards such as EBUcore or PBcore,

Moving images include a range of materials upon which sequences of visual images
have been recorded or registered and which create the illusion of movement when pro-
jected,  broadcast,  or  played  back  (by  means  of  a  projector,  television  set,  computer,
software or equivalent devices). Such images may or may not be accompanied by sound.
The definition includes moving images of all types, e.g., features, shorts, news footage,
trailers, outtakes, screen tests, educational and training documentaries, experimental
or independent productions, study films or video, home movies, unedited materials, tele-
vision broadcasts, commercials, spot announcements, recorded performances of con-
certs, ballets, plays, and CCTV footage etc. It encompasses both live action and anima-
tion and includes all analogue and digital formats.

While many moving image archives also have audio materials in their collections, this
manual does not offer detailed guidance for describing audio media. However, the Man-
ual does provide ways to describe physical and technical characteristics of analogue and
digital audio Items to assist with collection and preservation management.
