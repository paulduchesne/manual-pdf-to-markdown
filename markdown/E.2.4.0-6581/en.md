E.2.4 Other compilations

The nature of some compilations means that creating Works for each component is
neither relevant nor practical, i.e. compilation reels of unidentified or untitled content
(not usual in the bibliographic world but common in moving image archives).

There may not always be the immediate available knowledge as to whether something
is an intentional compilation (in which case it would be an aggregate) or simply a con-
venient  carrier.  Where  there  is  doubt  then  create  a  single  Aggregate  Manifestation  and
Aggregating Work224.

Later research and cataloguing may then establish whether this aggregate record is
retained and added to, or deleted after being used as a temporary working tool for initial
record creation of acquisitions.

224  It is easier for the Cataloguer to default to treating as an Aggregate initially and create a single Work,
Manifestation, and Item, rather than potentially create multiple skeletal “unidentified” Works, Manifestations
and Items that then have to be deleted subsequently if it is discovered the entity is an Aggregate.
