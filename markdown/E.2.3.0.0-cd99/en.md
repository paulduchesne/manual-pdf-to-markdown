E.2.3 Excerpt titles

Similarly, films that heavily utilise footage or excerpts from other films are not aggre-
gates, e.g., Dead men donâ€™t wear plaid, or Zelig, although these may have an associative
relationship with the original Works/Variants from which the footage was taken should
an  institution  wish.  They  are  using  partial  footage  combined  with  new  and  different
footage  shot  for  a  new  and  different  film  entirely,  rather  than  editing  together  whole
individual Works into an aggregate.
