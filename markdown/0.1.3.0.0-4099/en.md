0.1.3 Use

Instead of defining levels of cataloguing, this manual outlines core elements for mov-
ing  image  description.  The  core  elements  provide  the  basis  for  identification  of  a  re-
source and for facilitating the exchange of data from one system to another. These are
not “core” elements in the sense of a Dublin Core, EBUCore, or PBCore schema, but are
rather intended to illustrate common elements that are used in describing moving imag-
es and are referenced in the rules outlined in this manual. The elements are largely drawn
from EN 15744 and 15907. For a comparison of elements described in this Manual and EN



15907, please see Appendix G, Elements of Description comparison

This manual also provides a list of all the data elements associated with the entities
described.  Thus,  this  approach  provides  a  framework  for  the  minimum  and  maximum
amount of descriptive information allowed in a range of moving image cataloguing ac-
tivities existing in a large variety of environments.

Institutions  are  encouraged  to  include  as  many  of  the  non-core  elements  as  goals
and circumstances permit. None are considered mandatory by these guidelines, but an
institution may require that some are mandatory for internal purposes.
