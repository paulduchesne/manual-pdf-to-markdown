3.1.1 Identifier

Create  an  unambiguous  numerical  or  alphanumerical  reference  to  the  moving  im-
age  Item,  such  as  a  call  number,  barcode,  shelf  mark  or  similar,  to  uniquely  identify
the copy.113 This may be in addition to separate Acquisition and Accession number(s) or
identifier(s).

For digital files, the filename is not an identifier since filenames can change. Instead,
the filename is tracked as part of the technical metadata associated with a digital item.

As with Work and Manifestation Identifiers, an Item can have more than one Identi-
fier. For example, a film Item may have a barcode for the can and a shelf number for its
location. Note the type of Identifier using Identifier Type.
