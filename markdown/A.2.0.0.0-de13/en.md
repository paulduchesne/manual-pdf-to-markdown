A.2.0 Preferred

The title of a moving image Work or Variant when first released, broadcast, published
or transmitted (i.e. mounted online) in the country or countries of origin ( see 1.3.3 Coun-
try of reference.

The preferred title is the chief name (also referred to as “main” or “original” title) of
any moving image Work or Variant. The preferred title may include part title and series/
serial information for moving image materials issued in multiple parts, e.g., episodes in a
film or TV serial. See A.2.7 Moving images with probable or questionable titles.

In cases where the preferred Work/Variant title cannot be determined but there is a
title  on  the  Manifestation/Item,  the  title  on  the  Manifestation/Item  being  catalogued
may be used as the preferred title for the Work or Variant.

If the preferred title is ascertained at some point and is different from the Manifes-
tation/Item title, the Manifestation/Item title may then be added to the Work or Variant
as an alternative title.

When no title at all can be found for a Work or Variant, follow the procedure set out

in the A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles section.
