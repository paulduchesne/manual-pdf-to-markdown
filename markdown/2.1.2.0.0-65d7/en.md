2.1.2 Changes in the format

If  the  embodiment  of  a  Work/Variant  involves  changes  in  format,  the  resulting

product is a new Manifestation, e.g., a change from 70mm to 35mm.

Create a new Manifestation when there is evidence of at least one (or more than one)

of the following changes from the original format:

•	 Changes to the physical format or the digital file on which it is fixed;

•	 Changes to the display characteristics (i.e. in aspect ratio, sound or colour

characteristics, etc.);

•	 Change in the container (i.e. cassette to cartridge as container for a tape).

Include  and  describe  any  of  the  distinguishing  physical  changes  according  to  the

guidelines in 2.3.4 Format.

The example below shows a number of possible Manifestations of the original Italian

version of Il gattopardo (Italy, France, Luchino Visconti, 1963).

Example: change in format

Il gattopardo (Italy, France, Luchino Visconti, 1963) 85
Theatrical release, 35mm, Cinemascope – aspect ratio 2,35 : 1
Theatrical release, 70mm, Cinemascope – aspect ratio 2,20 : 1

Example: change in format and publication context

84  The definitions that individuate a “new” M. I. Manifestation and distinguish one from another are mainly
based on YEE 2008 (draft), 81.

In-house  copying  of  an  institution’s  holding  onto  a  different  format,  e.g.  a  video
transfer of a 35mm film does not necessitate creation  of a  new  Manifestation.  In  this
case there is also the option of simply creating an Item for the copy, and linking it to the
same Manifestation as the source Item.

This  option  depends  on  an  institution’s  policy.  Some  may  choose  always  to  create
a  new  Manifestation,  whilst  others  may  decide  to  create  a  new  Manifestation  where
change in format and change in distribution/publication coincide but just create a new
Item where change in format is as a result of in-house copying.

It is for an institution to decide on which approach it prefers and apply consistently.
