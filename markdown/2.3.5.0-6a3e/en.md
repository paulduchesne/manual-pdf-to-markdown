2.3.5 Extent of a Manifestation96

The concept of extent as applied to Manifestations is the “ideal” logical, physical, or
temporal (duration) units and not a description of a real physical object. Actual objects
in the collection are described at the Item level.

The extent of a Manifestation must be recorded as a reference for the completeness
of all the related Items, using appropriate authoritative secondary sources where feasible.

2.3.5.1 Logical extent of a Manifestation

Logical extent is the number of discrete logical units which make up the Manifesta-
tion, both for analogue (e.g. reels, cassettes, discs) and digital (cassettes, discs, files),
considering that the digital Manifestations may be bound to a physical carrier (such as
DVD) or exist without a defined carrier (such as online streaming media, podcasts, etc.).

For digital Manifestations, there can be two extents: one for the number of files, and

one for the extent of the carrier (e.g., 2 LTO6 tapes).

Example:

A home video publication: DVD in 2 discs
A theatrical print: in 6 reels
A hard-disk stored film in 3 files

Record the number of the logical units of a Manifestation in Arabic numerals, and, if
necessary, specify the type of unit, for example, reel, roll, disc, file, etc. Selection should
be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaus-
tive, can be found in D.7.6 Manifestation Unit Types.

If the number of the logical units of a Manifestation is uncertain, use a question mark
following the unit count97 or record the uncertain number preceded by “approximately.”98

96  Partially based on EN 15907, 6.8 except for the physical components/units number, which is not provided
for in the standard.
97  AMIM2, 5B5, p.9
98  RDA: 3.4.0.4



If the number of the logical units of a Manifestation is indeterminate, record the in-

formation using a value of “unknown.”

Alternatively, provide for a distinguishing “precision” field specifying if the unit num-

ber is exact, approximate or unknown.

2.3.5.2 Physical extent of a Manifestation99

Physical  extent  is  the  total  “ideal”  length  or  footage  of  the  medium  carrying  the
moving image Manifestation (using appropriate authoritative secondary sources where
feasible such as filmographies, censorship visas, etc.).

The actual length is a characteristic of a singular Item since it can be different for

multiple Items exemplifying the same Manifestation.

Record the total length in Arabic numerals, in metres or feet.

For digital Manifestations, record the total storage of all files that comprise the Man-

ifestation. Use Arabic numerals followed by MB, GB, or TB as appropriate.

The Unit of Measurement (feet, metres, GB, etc.) can be provided in a separate field. This

could be two separate fields side by side – one for numbers and one for size measurement.

If the length of a Manifestation is uncertain, use a question mark following the unit
count or record the uncertain number preceded by “approximately.” In a note, give an
explanation for the estimated footage or metre count, where known. Estimating the to-
tal storage size for a digital Manifestation can be particularly difficult, since storage can
vary depending on technical characteristics of the file(s).

If the length of a Manifestation is unknown, record the information using a value of

“unknown.”

Alternatively, provide for a distinguishing “precision” field specifying if the length is

exact, approximate or unknown.

2.3.5.2.1 Physical extent of an Aggregate Manifestation

For Aggregate Manifestations record the length or footage of the whole, i.e. the total
in feet or metres of all the units that constitute the Aggregate. In addition there is
the option to qualify this with details of the physical extent of each individual unit in
either a Notes field, or in multiple occurrences of the duration fields, depending on
what systems used permit or an institution decides.

For more information about aggregates, seeAppendix E, Aggregates.

2.3.5.3 Duration of a Manifestation100

This is the total duration/running time under normal or specific playback conditions
(e.g. a specific frame rate). It represents the concept of “ideal” duration/running time
(i.e., the duration reported on the moving image Manifestation itself – i.e., on the con-
tainer, on the accompanying material, on the wrapper of metadata in a digital file or re-
ported by authoritative secondary sources such as filmographies, censorship visas, etc.).
In cases where it is known that the time on the Manifestation is incorrect and all Items
will inherit the same incorrect duration, record the accurate duration and make a note
about the error/discrepancy found on the Manifestation.

The actual duration is usually considered a characteristic of a singular moving image

Item, since it can differ among multiple Items exemplifying the same Manifestation.

Record, in Arabic numerals, the total duration/running time in minutes, normally round-
ed off to the nearest minute. Optionally, include minutes and seconds, or, for a higher level
of precision and to enable calculations, use the format HH:MM:SS. This numeric format will
help to calculate estimated digital storage in analogue-to-digital transfer projects.

If the duration/running time of a Manifestation is uncertain, use a question mark fol-
lowing the unit count or, if the system allows, use the qualifier “Duration Precision” and
add the term “approximate.” (see 2.3.5.3.4 Duration Precision)

In a note, give an explanation for the estimated duration/running time, if such infor-

mation applies. 101

If the duration/running time of a Manifestation is unknown, record the information

using a value of “unknown.”

2.3.5.3.1 Duration of an Aggregate Manifestation

For Aggregate Manifestations record the duration of the whole, i.e. the total running
time of all the units that constitute the Aggregate. In addition there is the option to
qualify this with details of the duration of each individual unit in either a Notes field,
or  in  multiple  occurrences  of  the  duration  fields,  depending  on  what  systems  used
permit or an institution decides.

Example:

DVD “The Audrey Hepburn Collection” contains 3 films, all with extra features. The
running times for each of those 3 units are given on the container.

101  Based on FIAF 1991, 5.3.4.2.



The total running time of these may be added as duration, with an additional clarify-
ing note detailing the running times of the individual units.

For more information about Aggregates see Appendix E, Aggregates.

2.3.5.3.2 Duration of a Manifestation associated with a Work/
Variant of the silent era

When recording duration of Manifestations of a Work/Variant of the silent era, take
into account that the rate of frames per second varied over the years and between
Variants/Manifestations. Also take into account the so-called “stretch frame” prac-
tice, adopted after the silent era, which “increases the number of frames printed on
a film to enable films shot at silent speeds to be projected at sound speed and retain
the original temporal characteristics.”102

In a note, indicate the frame rate on which the duration is based or if the Manifesta-
tion is the result of a “stretch frame” practice.103 (See also 3.1.5.12 Frame Rate)

2.3.5.3.3 Duration of a Broadcast Manifestation associated
with a Work/Variant

When recording duration for Broadcast Manifestations there are two potential sets of
data: a Slot Duration and an Actual Running Time. If the system allows, note the type
of duration in the Duration Type element (see 2.3.5.3.5 Duration Type).

Slot Duration relates to information from TV listings or publicity information for the
programmed “slot” on the TV channel, whereas Actual Running Time relates to the
exact running time of the entity when it was broadcast, excluding any inserted adver-
tisements, etc. Thus, for example, an episode of the soap opera “Coronation Street”
may have a Slot Duration of 30 minutes, but an Actual Running Time of 24 minutes.

Similarly, record the start and end time of the broadcast, ideally using 24-hour clock
notation, e.g. 23:00 rather than 11:00pm. This may also involve two potential sets of
data: a whole slot start and end time, or the actual more precise start and end time
of the broadcast.

It is for an institution to choose whether to record both sets of data in each instance
or limit to either just slot or actual broadcast/running times.

2.3.5.3.4 Duration Precision

In this qualifier, note whether the duration is exact, approximate, or estimated. Items
can apply the additional “stock maximum.”

2.3.5.3.5 Duration Type

Where appropriate, add the type of duration being described. For example, broadcast
materials could have “Slot Duration” and “Actual Duration.”
