F.1 Survey of Moving Image Cataloguing
Practice in Film Archives (2005-2006)

Specific areas the community wanted revised:229

•	 Expand and improve physical description, including complete information

about physical conditions and restoration procedures. Implement the descrip-
tion of digital objects.

•

Improve the Copyright area.

•	 Streamline and re-structure the Notes Area, currently too extensive and con-

taining too many heterogeneous pieces of information.

•	 Adopt or suggest consistent criteria for the content description, especially for

non-fiction moving images.

•

Introduce a Standard Number Area (i.e. to include the ISAN -International
Standard Audiovisual Number – or national standards).

•

Introduce a Terms of Availability / Access Area.

To address issues particular to moving image archives, the revision should also consider:

•

•

•

the history of the document in hand before and after the acquisition in the
archive

the description of the collection to which it belongs, according to the specific
archival standard rules (i.e. ISAD)

links with moving image-related materials associated with moving image
items, such as papers, censorship visas, booklets, laboratory reports, archive
notes, etc.
