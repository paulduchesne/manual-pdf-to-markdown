A.2 Title Types

This manual recommends a title + title type approach for the treatment of various
titles  that  may  be  associated  with  any  Moving  Image  Work,  Variant,  Manifestation  or
Item (WVMI).

This would be done with separate title and title type fields in close proximity.

However, this approach is optional, considering that not all systems may be able to
accommodate title types in fields that establish the relationship of the title type to the
title. Additionally, not all systems will be able to represent clearly the WVMI entities. In
such cases, where possible or considered useful, it is recommended that the title + title
type include an additional element or description intended to denote the entity to which
it belongs. The underlying philosophy is to associate as many titles to the respective enti-
ties as possible, within the bounds of time/resources and systems, to facilitate discovery.

The different titles types have been combined in a single section to aid in real-world
cataloguing, where one may have an item-in-hand but be making assessments about
the title of the Work or Variant associated with the Item, as well as physical characteris-



tics that are particular to the Item but which do not signal a change in the content itself.
This is often the case for archival moving images where titles can be readily changed,
misidentified by a well-meaning collector, or completely eliminated before the material
reaches an institution.130
