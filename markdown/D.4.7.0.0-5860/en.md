D.4.7 Manufacture

A Manufacture Event represents a “common” event within which the embodiment of
a Manifestation occurs, owing to the instances of a number of physical items that bear
the same characteristics.

Therefore, the manufacture event of a moving image Manifestation corresponds to
the activity within which it was fixed on a physical carrier, through particular technical
processes such as film printing, telecine, video copying, digitisation, mastering, etc., or
where it is saved to an “immaterial” medium, such as a digital file.

A Manufacture Event may be associated with instances of Agent, e.g. a laboratory
that prints all the copies for a theatrical distribution or a studio that masters the DVDs
for a home video publication.

A Manufacture Event may be associated with instances of “Other” relationship(s).
