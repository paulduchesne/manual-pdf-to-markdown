E.7 Series, Serials and Newsreels

All the above examples and modelling of aggregates have purposefully not included
newsreels  or  film  or  TV  series/serials.  This  is  because  these  do  not  actually  constitute
aggregates under the Aggregates definition.

FRBR includes the terms “serials” and “series” within examples of Collection Aggre-
gates. However, these are in relation to bibliographic materials, and moving image se-
ries/serials  are  not  the  equivalent  of  articles  written  for  a  periodical,  but  different  in
nature.
