1.3.8 History

Record historical information about events of interest in the creation of the original
moving image Work/Variant that is of value for your users, such as censorship history,
production versions, and the like. This historical information may be recorded in associ-
ation with instances of Events or Agents.

If desired, institutions may include historical information that crosses over into being
about the Manifestation(s) and/or Item(s). This may be done where there is value to the
user in keeping all the information together for research or clarification purposes rather
than across disparate Manifestation and Item records. This may also be applied where
no History fields exist in an institution’s system at Manifestation or Item levels, or a no
hierarchy one level structure is used.

Example:

Christopher Columbus (United Kingdom, 1949, David MacDonald)66
There are three documented versions. Version one: which has the shortened reels
3A and 3B; Version two: which has the shorter ending; Version three: which has the
long ending (this script is based on the full length reels 3A and 3B and on the short
ending, as this is the export version.
The  short  ending  (version  two)  has  Columbus  reinstated  by  the  King  and  Queen,
him leaving their presence and telling Juana he will be remembered longer than the
monarchs as he walks down a corridor. The longer version (version three) has a more
American feel with two sailors informing Columbus of the great nation his discovery
will give rise to, complete with quotes from Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.

1.3.8.1 Custodial history

If desired, write a brief custodial history of the Work/Variant if known, particularly
for rare and unique materials. Indicate the current holding institution of the original or
master material if known.

Information on the provenance of the specific Items in an archive’s collection should

be included in the Item sections.

La porta del cielo (Italy, 1945, Vittorio De Sica)

throughout the period of Nazi occupation of Rome and served as an excuse
to hide and protect Jewish people, anti-fascists, etc...

La grande illusion (France, 1937, Jean Renoir)
The shooting of the film lasted two years (1935-1936) and the first projec-
tion was in 1937.

•

any other information relevant to the history of the Work and its production

Christopher Columbus (United Kingdom, 1949, David MacDonald)
Location shooting in Barbados was fraught with difficulties. The re-created
ship stuck on launch, was then later rammed, suffered mechanical failure
and finally caught fire. The stand-in ship was then lost at sea twice. Loca-
tion shooting was hampered by the heat and the local gaol had to be used
to keep the Technicolor film cool. There was also a troublesome parrot that
would shout “tea break” during a dramatic scene.69
