D.5.5 Unreleased

Refers  to  Manifestations  which  do  not  represent  a  release/distribution  event,  but
where the work was intended for release (therefore, distinct from “Not for release”, see
above), e.g. the film was made, completed and intended for release, but was not then
released due to censorship or political impediments, or other reason.

Examples:

Robinson Warszawksi (Poland, 1948, Jerzy Zarzycki)
Film  was  never  released.  It  ran  into  censorship  problems  for  portraying  the  he-
roism  of  non-Communist  underground  movement  that  also  fought  against  the
Nazis. Film was re-edited with major plot changes and released as Miasto Nieuja-
rzmione in 1950.

Primavera (Italy, ca. 1920, Licurgo Tioli) (Italian silent film, which is not included in
the censorship records and according to the sources, was never released/distrib-
uted, but it exists as a nitrate tinted 35mm print at the CSC-Cineteca Nazionale
in Rome).
