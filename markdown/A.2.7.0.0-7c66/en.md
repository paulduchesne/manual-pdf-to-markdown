A.2.7 Moving images with probable or questio-
nable titles175

There are instances where the title from a Manifestation/Item may not be inherited
by the Work or Variant. Such is the case when a Manifestation/Item contains a probable
or questionable title.

If the Manifestation/item contains a probable or questionable title, this title may be
included as a component in constructing the supplied/devised title, or it may be used alone
as the supplied/devised title for the Work. (See A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles). The proba-
bility or questionable nature of the title, and its source, should be made clear in a note.

174  See A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles (i.e. Creating titles for untitled/unidentified entities or production material)
and examples of titling
175  Based on AMIM2, 1F2.1.



For example, an Item may have a probable or questionable title but the title is not
the preferred title for the Work and the preferred title for the Work cannot be discov-
ered. Some institutions may choose to record a probable or questionable title as the title
proper, or preferred title, for the Manifestation/Item, but not as the preferred title for
the Work or Variant. Some institutions may use the probable or questionable title as the
preferred title for the Manifestation/item and Work (or Work and Variant).

The treatment of probable or questionable titles may vary among institutions. Many
institutions’ catalogues contain a mixture of Collection-, Work-, Variant-, and Manifes-
tation-level records that function as the “parent” record or the topmost “node”, to which
the units of moving image material are associated. In the absence of a Work or informa-
tion about a Work, many institutions represent what they have.

For purposes of discoverability, accessibility, and standardisation, it is recommended
that a Work is always represented in the catalogue, even if it means utilising and repeat-
ing information more strictly related to a Variant, Manifestation or Item.

The Work can take the title of the Item, Manifestation or Variant, until such time as
further research or identification assists in establishing the preferred title for the Work.
The  crucial  factor  is  coupling  the  title  with  a  descriptive  identifier  denoting  that  it  is

176  Many archives place information found on the Manfestation/Item in quotes to indicate the data is tran-
scribed from the physical item itself or the audiovisual content of the entity. This practice is not recommended
unless required by local cataloguing rules or local system requirements.

“supplied” or “devised,” whether within the title itself or via a juxtaposed field such as
“Title Type.” If there is no Title Type field than a Notes or other field could be utilised.

Examples of partially and fully supplied titles for a variety of scenarios can be found

in the “form terms” list provided in D.18 List of form terms for Supplied/Devised titles.
