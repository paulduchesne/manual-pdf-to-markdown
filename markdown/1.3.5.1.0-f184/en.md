1.3.5.1 Language Term

Record  the  language(s)  by  taking  the  most  suitable  value(s)  from  a  controlled  list  of
languages.

This can be an in-house list but it is preferable to use a standard language list such as
the ISO 639 codes, including ISO 639-2, 693-3 and 639-5 (http://www.loc.gov/standards/
iso639-2/langhome.html).

Optionally, record the language code as found in ISO 639, where allowable.

If no language can be determined, the information can be omitted or indicated by a

value of “unknown”.
