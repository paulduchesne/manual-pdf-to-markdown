E.3.1 Collection Aggregates

Sets  of  multiple  independently  created  Works/Variants,  which  are  “published”225

together in a single manifestation.

Examples:

Universal Cinema Classics’ Going my way (1944)/Holiday Inn (1942).

Both works were republished in one volume on DVD by Universal Studios in
2001. The two works are complete and were not changed in any noticeable
way. Although both films were produced by the same studio and are both
musicals, there is no other significant relationship between them. The story
lines are quite different and they don’t share any common characters.

The aggregate also contains two additional works: the trailers for both fea-
tures.

The following two examples have production companies or time period themes
