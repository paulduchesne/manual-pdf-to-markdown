3.3 Relationships of an Item

A relationship associates an instance of an Item with another instance of an entity.

Relationships can be implemented in many ways, depending on the purpose, the mod-
elling paradigm, or architectural constraints of the chosen platform. These guidelines are
intended to be data structure neutral.120 Therefore, these guidelines cannot prescribe ex-
actly how to demonstrate relationships. Instead they recommend that certain relation-
ships be established without instruction on how precisely those links be made manifest.

An Item may have relationships with the following:

•	 Agent(s)
•
Event(s)
•	 Other
•	 Manifestation
