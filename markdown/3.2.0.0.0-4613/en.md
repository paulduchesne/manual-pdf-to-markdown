3.2 Boundaries between Items

The boundaries between moving image Items is determined primarily by the bound-
aries between Manifestations (see 2.1 Boundaries between Manifestations). There may
be multiple Items associated to a Manifestation that are, for all intents and purposes,
exact copies, but which may have small differences that do not necessitate representa-
tion as a Manifestation. For example, an institution may have two DVD-R copies of the
same Manifestation, with cosmetic differences in their labels.
