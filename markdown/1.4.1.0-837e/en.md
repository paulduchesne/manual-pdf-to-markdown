1.4.1 Agents (e.g. Cast, Credits, Person,
Organisation, etc.)

An Agent is defined as an entity that is involved in the creation, realisation, curation
or  exploitation  of  a  Work/Variant  and  who  is  considered  to  have  major  responsibility
for, or be of major importance to, the Work/Variant. Typical distinctions between Agent
types  are  Person,  Corporate  Body,  Family  and  Person  Group.71  This  includes  cast  and
credits for the Work/Variant.

Agent(s) may also have relationships to an instance of a specific Event or of an “Oth-

er” relationship in connection with the Work/Variant.

Because responsibility for moving image materials is most often complex and highly
diverse,  institutions  -  particularly  those  with  special  interests  -  should  determine  the
types of activities they wish to include. These activities may vary from institution to insti-
tution according to the types of moving image material held. For example, an institution
holding primarily television material may consider the activity of producer more import-
ant than that of director. Institutions whose collections are primarily composed of mo-
tion picture material may value equally the activities of directors and producers. Provide
access to Agents when they have made an important contribution to the particular Work
or Variant, even when the type of responsibility (credit function) is one that may not be
considered major in other Works/Variants or types of Works/Variants.72

Agents may be described in two ways: as discrete index points, and/or merged into
one field where the credits are listed in order of role importance or as transcribed from
the Work.

Optionally, record multiple instances of Agent, e.g., cast and credits, associated with

aggregated Works/Variants (See E.6 Credits (i.e. Agents) for Aggregates ).

For recording the attributes of Agents (e.g. first name, last name, nationality, etc.),
refer to authoritative sources such as AACR2, applicable RDA chapters for recording at-
tributes of Persons, Families, and Corporate Bodies or tools such as the Virtual Interna-
tional Authority File (VIAF) (viaf.org), Library of Congress Name Authority File (author-
ities.loc.gov),  Library  of  Congress  Linked  Data  Service  (id.loc.gov),  Getty  Union  List  of
Artists Names (ULAN), International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI).

It is also recommended where possible to register key Agents with any of the afore-

mentioned authority bodies if they are not already included.

Optionally, if the Agent is credited under a name that is not identical with the pre-
ferred name from an authority file, record the name as used in the current instance of
the related entity.

Examples:

Bob  Robertson  (pseudonym/screen  name  used  by  the  director  Sergio  Leone  at  the

beginning of the career)

Terence  Hill  (pseudonym/screen  name  used  by  the  actor  Mario  Girotti  in  the  most

known part of his career)

Sofia Lazzaro (first pseudonym/screen name used by the actress Sophia Loren, whose

birth name is Sofia Villani Scicolone).

1.4.1.1 Agent Activity

This describes the activity or role of the Agent in relation to the moving image Work/

Variant (e.g. credit terms).

Record one or more Agent Activity terms, for example, “animator,” “cast,” “chore-
ographer,” etc., to express the nature of the agent’s relationship to the Work or Variant.
Choose the single most specific term, if possible. Selection should be made from a con-
trolled list of terms, such as the FIAF Glossary of Filmographic Terms73.

If no suggested terms apply, compose a term to describe the relationship between
the Agent and the Work/Variant being catalogued. If the relationship is ambiguous, use
a value to indicate this, for example, “unknown” or “on-screen participant” to indicate a
person appearing on screen in a capacity that is indeterminate or not covered by typical
terms.74  Optionally,  when  the  role  performed  by  an  Agent  is  probable  but  not  certain,
provide the function name followed by a question mark.

Besides  the  principal  Agent  Activity  suggested,  institutions,  particularly  those  with
special  interests,  should  create  and  apply  in-house  value  lists  of  other  specific  Agent
Types, which may vary from institution to institution.

Record in a note any additional details that cannot be expressed through controlled
terms. (e.g. “appears only in final scene”, etc.). If a name is known to be fictitious, or
requires clarification, make a note giving the actual name.

Give the Agent(s) and Agent Activity in the terms and language in which they appear,
either in the sources of information or in the language of the institution, or both. If more
than one Agent is associated with a particular role connected with a Work/Variant or

TF, Part II, Core Attributes and Relationships, Commonly-Occurring Roles, pp. 16-18.



Event, where possible or desirable, record the names in the order indicated by the sequence,
layout, or typography of the names on the source of information. Preserving the ordering of
the credited persons should be determined by the requirements of individual institutions.75

Examples:

Les Enfants du paradis
réalisation, Marcel Carné
scenario et dialogue, Jacques Prevert
musique, Maurice Thiriet

OR

Enfants du paradis, Les
director, Marcel Carné
script and dialogue, Jacques Prevert
music, Maurice Thiriet

Star wars
Director, George Lucas
Executive Producer, George Lucas
Producer, Gary Kurtz
Screenplay, George Lucas

If Agents are added as index points rather than listed or described in order of impor-
tance, an organisation may choose to put the Agent Activity or role term(s) at the end
of the name.

Examples:

Les Enfants du paradis
Carné, Marcel, réalisation
Prevert, Jacques, scenario, dialogue
Thiriet, Maurice, musique

Star wars
Lucas, George, director, executive producer, screenplay
Kurtz, Gary, producer
