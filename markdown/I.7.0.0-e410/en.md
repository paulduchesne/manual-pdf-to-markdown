For  a  year  following  the  thwarting  of  the  Apocalypse,  Dean  Winchester  tries  to  live  a
normal family life with Lisa and Ben. When his brother Sam suddenly turns up freed from
Lucifer’s cage in Hell, Dean teams up with him and becomes a hunter again but soon
discovers there is something different and more ruthless about Sam. The two become
entangled in a quest for souls that ties in with Crowley’s scheming and Castiel’s struggles
with Free Will and determination to win the civil war raging in Heaven.
