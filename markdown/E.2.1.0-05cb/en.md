E.2.1 Aggregate or Carrier

It is important to distinguish between actual intended compilation or multi-compo-
nent moving images, e.g. Victorian cinema no. 8 (containing various short films from the
1890s edited together onto a new reel for a particular theatrical showing or publication),
and an unintentional compilation, reflecting simple use of a single carrier, i.e. two short
Charlie Chaplin films that happen to be acquired on one reel or transferred onto one tape
for storage convenience.

Editing and creative assembly decisions were taken to create the first example, and
it constitutes a Collection Aggregate (see E.3.1 Collection Aggregates). The second was
just incidental or convenient assembly and is not an aggregate, and so would not have
an  aggregate  Manifestation.  The  two  Chaplin  films  would  each  have  their  own  Work,
Manifestation, and Item records, but those Items would have the same location/package
number.

Any aggregate will have an element of intention, whether simple or complex. Assess-
ments will need to be made, where possible, as to whether the intention was for creative/
intellectual or convenient purposes, and then represented accordingly.
