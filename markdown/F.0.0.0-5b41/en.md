Appendix F, Additional background
on the manual update

When FIAF established its Cataloguing Commission in 1968 (which merged with the
Documentation Commission in 1997 and is now called the Cataloguing and Documenta-
tion Commission), the new Commission set, as its first task, the creation of a compendi-
um of advice on practical cataloguing. The result of this work was the Film Cataloguing
manual (New York: Burt Franklin & Co.) published in 1979.

Having completed this background work, the Commission turned, in 1980, to the next
task – that of providing an international standard set of rules for the style, content, and
format of cataloguing records. The Commission relied upon the International Standard
for Bibliographic Description for non-Book Materials (ISBD (NBM)) (London: IFLA, 1977,
rev. 1987) from the related discipline of librarianship, which had already achieved rec-
ognition among library professionals worldwide. Because the ISBD (NBM) rules were di-
rected to generalised collections of widely available audio-visual materials, they did not
solve  the  technical,  preservation  and  scholarly  information  needs  inherent  to  archival
moving images. The ISBD (NBM) could nonetheless serve as a model for FIAF by providing
a framework into which the Commission could place its basic principles of archival mov-
ing image cataloguing and upon which it then built these principles into a complete set
of cataloguing rules, The FIAF Cataloguing Rules for Film Archives (1991).

The  resulting  manual  divided  archival  moving  image  cataloguing  information  into
seven areas of description along the lines of ISBD (NBM), but with some differences in
the areas of description and their order to address the particular needs of moving image
materials.

In  2004,  the  Commission  recognised  the  need  to  revise  and  update  a  manual  con-
ceived for a non-computerized and “analogue” world. It designed and disseminated the
Survey of Moving Image Cataloguing Practice in Film Archives (2005-2006). The survey
responses revealed specific areas the community wanted revised and issues particular
to moving image archives that the new approach should consider (see Appendix F.1 for a
listing of these areas and issues).

In 2008, the Commission met in Paris to set goals and a plan of action for new guide-

lines (see Appendix F.2 for listing of goals).

The authors of this revision compared the 1991 FIAF Rules with the most recent FR-
BR-based cataloguing documents, publications and standards related to moving imag-
es, in order to evaluate and take aspects of them into account. These documents, publi-
cations and standards included:

•	 RDA: Resource Description and Access (RDA)

•	 The thought papers of the Online Audiovisual Catalogers (OLAC) Cataloging

Policy Committee (CAPC) Moving Image Work-Level Records Task Force

•	 The work done by Martha Yee (Cataloging Supervisor at the UCLA Film & Tele-
vision Archive): Cataloging Rules (2008) and Moving image cataloging: how to



create and how to use a moving image catalog (2007)

•	 The European Standards Committee (CEN) Cinematographic Works Standard

(CWS) (EN 15744 and EN 15907).
