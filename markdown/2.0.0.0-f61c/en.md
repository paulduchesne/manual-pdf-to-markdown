2.0 Definition

A moving image Manifestation is the embodiment of a moving image Work/Variant.
Manifestations usually include all analogue, digital and online media associated with a
particular embodiment of a Work/Variant.

A Manifestation possesses common characteristics with respect to shared intellectu-

al content and physical format, e.g., releases, broadcasts, etc.

It may be whole or incomplete or a fragment.

A Manifestation is not exclusively bound to a single Work/Variant, since it can be an
aggregate for reasons connected to the publication, to the commercial release, or for
mere convenience. A Manifestation can therefore be associated or linked to more than
one Work/Variant, where an institution’s system allows.

For Aggregate Manifestations see Appendix E, Aggregates.
