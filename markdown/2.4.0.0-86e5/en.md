2.4 Relationships of a Manifestation

A relationship associates an instance of Manifestation with another instance of an

entity.

Relationships can be implemented in many ways, depending on the purpose, the mod-
elling paradigm, or architectural constraints of the chosen platform. These guidelines are
intended to be data structure neutral.105 Therefore, these guidelines cannot prescribe ex-
actly how to demonstrate relationships. Instead they recommend that certain relation-
ships be established without instruction on how precisely those links be made manifest.

A Manifestation may have relationships with the following:

•	 Agent(s)
•
Event(s)
•	 Other
•
•	 Work
•	 Variant

Item(s)
