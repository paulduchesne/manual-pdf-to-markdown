H.1.1 Background information

H.1.1.2 Source of data

Regarding the source of intellectual property data, it is recommended to obtain the
relevant information from onscreen text, taken from the first official manifestation in
the primary country of origin. Historically this has been a theatrical release in the prima-
ry country of production, but as that model changes to include simultaneous online pub-
lication of moving image works across multiple territories, this recommendation should
accommodate  this  fluidity:  capture  the  data  from  the  best  available  manifestation
source representing the arguable ‘first fixation’ of the work, and document that source
in your work record. Alternatively, use information given by the production companies or
rights holders, or from other authoritative secondary sources.



H.1.1.3 Authors of a moving image Work

The  Authors  of  a  moving  image  work  are  the  first  owners  of  the  intellectual  property
rights. As the defined authors of the moving image work differ substantially across terri-
tories, the following examples illustrate these differences, and emphasise the usefulness
of a broad data capture policy.

UK: The Producer and the Principal Director are the Authors of the work, and therefore
the first copyright holders.

Producer: this can be either a person (natural person) or a company (legal person). The
producer is defined as ‘the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the making
of the film are undertaken’. The notion of the ‘producer’ presupposes that at the core of
the production process there is a person or company which co-ordinates, controls and
organises the production. For this reason, the recommendation below is to capture both
Production Company and named individual Producer.

Principal Director: as credited onscreen.

France: distinct from the UK model, in France it is those natural persons (not legal per-
sons) who make a creative contribution to the film that are considered authors, so pro-
duction company / producer are not authors.

Director

Author of the script

Author of the adaptation (if different)

Author of the dialogue (if different)

Author of musical composition written for the film

(plus ‘assimilated’ authors of pre-existing protected works e.g. author of an original nov-
el, or playwright)

Germany: The German model is very similar to the French, again focusing on the creative
contributions made by natural persons, but the list can be extended to include a broader
set of persons – e.g. cameramen as author – as German Law does not specify the persons
deemed as authors.

USA: The US model has a number of categories of authors who make creative contribu-
tions (rather like Germany), but the law does not define the ‘authors’, and in any case
most individuals will be contracted under ‘work for hire’ provisions which means that the
producer is the owner of the intellectual property rights.

These first owners of the intellectual property rights (or their heirs, in the event of their
death) retain these rights until one of two events takes place:



1. They (or their heirs) actively sell, assign or otherwise transfer the rights

2. The rights expire, according to specific legal framework(s)

Again, the definitions of what makes a work ‘out of copyright’ differ across territories
and periods, so it is impractical to offer a universally compliant cataloguing approach.
However, in many contexts, the lapse occurs at a stated period after the death of the
last of the Authors (or the ‘connected persons’ in the UK). For example, in the UK frame-
work, the work is out of copyright at 70 years following the last death of these ‘connect-
ed persons’: Director, Screenplay author, Dialogue author, Music composer.

In the US, where a moving image Work is often a Work of corporate ownership, the cur-
rent copyright term for a published Work expires 95 years after initial publication or 120
years  after  creation,  whichever  expires  first.  However,  between  1923-2002  there  were
periods where other formalities needed to be followed in order to retain copyright: during
some periods, a Item required “notice” (a copyright symbol or statement) on the work;
in other periods, the Work had to be renewed in the 28th year after initial publication.246

As  intellectual  property  rights  can  be  transferred,  and  can  lapse,  it  is  recommended
that cataloguers capture statements about the rights’ status: current / previous / out
of copyright, and the dates of transfer / lapse, as described below. In addition, as death
dates  are  so  critical  in  establishing  the  status  of  out  of  copyright,  it  is  recommended
that cataloguers capture the death dates of key contributors where known (and where
feasible, that person records for key ‘authors’ are associated with equivalent entities in
an official registry of persons, such as VIAF, ISNI or other).

H.1.1.4 Layers of protection for the ‘work’ as abstrac-
tion, and the ‘fixation’ or ‘recording’ of the work in a
concrete form

The complexity and variation in the intellectual property rights surrounding a mov-
ing image work also extends to multiple layers of protection, in some legal frameworks.
Bluntly described, these multiple layers protect the ‘work’ as an abstraction (with the
rights held by the ‘authors’, as defined above) and, separately, the ‘fixation’ or ‘recording’
of the work as a film. This second layer is often called Related Rights or Neighbouring
Rights, and often these rights are owned by the Producer.

This layered approach is not always present in law, for example in the UK it is the fixa-
tion (the recording) that is protected by copyright. But some prominent examples of this
layered approach are the USA, where a film is protected as an original work of expression
as distinct from the recording; and France and Germany, which both have separate pro-
tection for the work and the recording.

Given  the  territorial  variation,  once  again,  rather  than  recommend  different  data
properties for the different countries, instead it is recommended to capture a core set
of rights data properties, which should provide information sufficient for all possibilities

in the United States,” updated annually. http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm



within the different frameworks.

H.1.1.5 Orphan works

Orphan works are defined as those works which are ‘still protected by copyright but
whose authors or other rightholders are not known or cannot be located.’ (from the OHIM
Orphan  Works  Database  website  at  https://oami.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/obser-
vatory/orphan-works-database). The absence of information about ownership has pre-
vented archives from exploiting their collections in revenue-generating or access-driving
initiatives: for example, online display of digitised collections.

Multiple formal schemes are emerging to register so-called ‘orphan works’ works in
certified, searchable databases. These schemes require the registering organisation to
undertake ‘diligent search’ (e.g., the OWLS guidelines here: https://www.gov.uk/govern-
ment/publications/orphan-works-diligent-search-guidance-for-applicants)  with  mini-
mum requirements, and the registration then allows the organisation to exploit the work
within parametres defined in legal frameworks.

Three prominent examples (which offer slightly different exploitation rights as out-
comes of registration) are the European Union Orphan Works Database (https://oami.
europa.eu/orphanworks/);  the  UK  version,  called  Orphan  Works  Licensing  Scheme,  or
OWLS, (https://www.gov.uk/copyright-orphan-works); and the Canadian version, called
Unlocatable  Copyright  Owners  (http://www.cb-cda.gc.ca/unlocatable-introuvables/
brochure1-e.html). The United States has not yet passed legislation on orphan works, but
the Regsiter of Copyrights is actively seeking to change the laws.247

The cataloguer within a moving image archive that is undertaking such registration
should add data derived from that registration activity, for example unique identifier for
the registration, URL to online database record, link to certificate on PDF, etc.

H.1.1.6 Rights-protected works that may be used with-
in, or created during, a film production

These are the types of protected works which are often contained within a new moving
image work, or indeed created by the making of a moving image work, and which are
often referred to as ‘underlying rights’ or “third-party rights.” When establishing Man-
ifestation rights (see below), these underlying rights must be investigated and cleared
as required.

Literary Works – such as a pre-existing novel or play used as the basis for the film
screenplay

Dramatic Works – Script(s)

Musical Works – pre-existing music; commissioned music

Artistic Works – such as décor, costumes

247  Priorities and special projects of the United States Copyright Office (October 2011),

Performances – actors’ performances, musical performances of pre-existing mu-
sic, musical performances in commissioned music

Sound Recordings – if commissioned for pre-existing music

Films – such as archival footage; special effect footage
