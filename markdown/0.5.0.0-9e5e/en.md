0.5 Language and script of the description

The language of the original Work can be different from the language of a Manifestation
or Item. For example, the original Work title can be in the original creation language, but
the item being catalogued is a Variant with the title and key credits in a different lan-
guage. Where possible, data elements in the catalogue record for the Work are recorded
in the language and/or script of the original Work and may be transcribed from the Item
of an original manifestation of the Work or taken from other sources.

This will primarily be for data transcribed from the screen, e.g. Title and key agents (di-
rector,  producer,  cast,  etc.).  Do  not  confuse  this  with  describing  the  language  of  the
soundtrack, which is noted in specific language fields.

Data  elements  for  the  Variant,  Manifestation  and  Item  are  recorded  in  the  language
that is on the Variant, Manifestation or Item and should be transcribed from the Item
or from other sources in the appropriate language. Scripts, symbols or other characters
that cannot be transcribed as presented or are other than that used by the cataloguing
agency or institution may, if necessary, be transliterated in the script of the institution
or replaced with a cataloguer’s description. Use a recognised standard for transliteration
such as ISO 9 for Cyrillic characters, Pinyin for Chinese characters, or ALA-LC Romaniza-
tion Tables. Give an explanatory note for the addition, if necessary. Optionally, enclose
the cataloguer’s description in square brackets.

Example:

Original Chinese Title: 精武英雄
Transliterated Pinyin Title: Jīng wǔ yīngxióng
English Translated Title: Fist of Legend
