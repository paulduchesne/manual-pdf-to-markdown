1.1.2 Boundaries between Works and Variants/
Manifestations

The boundaries between a moving image Work and its Variant(s) (i.e. where a Variant
rather than a new Work may be created) may be drawn on the basis of one or more of
the following alterations to the content given below. 33

Change in footage and/or change in continuity (secondary editing)

•

different footage used from the original realisation of the Work, even where
footage used was shot at the same time and edited together by the same
people, or following the pattern set by original creators.

Examples:

The rules of the game (1939): exists only as a Variant of the original Work,
made partially from alternate takes to those used in the original release.

Various re-edited releases of Blade Runner (1982, 1986, 1992, 2007)

Mr. Arkadin (France-Spain-Switzerland, 1955, Orson Welles): eight differ-
ent Variants between 1955 and 1956, each one with differences in foot-
age and editing. Among them, three have the title Confidential Report.34

•

editing of a Work to create realisations that are shorter in extent/duration

Examples:

Große Freiheit Nr. 7 (Germany, 1944) (112 minutes)
Shortened Variant Große Freiheit Nr. 7 (109 minutes)

Works censored or edited for television broadcast, for showing on air-
planes, for showing in different parts of the country/world, etc.

Annie Leibovitz, Life through a Lens (USA, 2007-01-03), broadcast in TV
series American Masters
Shortened Variant (for British television): Annie Leibovitz, Life through a
Lens (UK, 2008-06-10), broadcast in TV series Imagine

Last Tango in Paris (USA, 1972, Bernardo Bertolucci)

foreign language versions, which were released on the same date as the
English language version.35

Sonorized Variant: Italy, 1931

A dog’s life (USA, 1918, Charles Chaplin)
Sonorized Variant: Vita da cani – sonorized with Italian intertitles – 193?

The yellow mask (USA, 1930, Harry Lachman)
Augmented  Variant:  Il  principe  corsaro  –  1931:  only  with  music,  songs
and  sound  effects,  plus  new  Italian  intertitles,  but  without  dialogue,
according  to  a  1930  law,  which  involved  the  first  spoken  foreign  films
distributed in Italy.

Hallelujah! (USA, 1929, King Vidor)
Augmented Variant: Alleluia! – addition of music, songs, sound effects,
and new Italian intertitles, but without dialogue; Italy, 1930

La presa di Roma (Italy, 1905)
Preservation/restoration  Variant:  addition  of  stills  and  explanation
texts; Italy, 2007. Restoration by Centro Sperimentale di Cinematogra-
fia-Cineteca Nazionale

35  Some institutions may have the 19 foreign language versions as 19 separate Manifestations, rather than
create 19 Variant records, particularly if the data relating to specific different dubbing credits is unavailable or
deemed of minor importance.



Change in performance/performers

•

removal and/or replacement and/or addition of any one or more of the con-
tributors (e.g., cast and/or crew), but not substantially most, associated with
a Work

Examples: restored versions of works often include credits for the responsi-
ble individuals and institutions

Nosferatu. Eine Symphonie des Grauens (Germany, 1922, Friedrich Wil-
helm Murnau)
Preservation/augmented  Variant  –  2005/6:  restoration  by  the  Fried-
rich-Wilhelm Murnau-Stiftung; Luciano Berriatùa (restorer)

erung: Filmarchiv Austria, Wien, Stephanie Gratzer in Zusammenarbeit

bing or subtitles

Dubbed  Variant  1:I  figli  del  deserto  –  Italian  (spoken  language)  -1935:
Carlo Cassola, voice of Oliver Hardy;
Dubbed Variant 2:, I figli del deserto – Italian (spoken language) 1946:
Alberto Sordi, voice of Oliver Hardy.

When an institution has set a policy not to use Variants, the boundaries will usually be
between a Work and Manifestations, i.e., a new Manifestation linked to the Work would
be created rather than a Variant, or else a separate new Work, depending on assessment
of the level of change or variation.

Boundaries  for  this  decision  are  akin  to  the  concepts  of  “versions  with  major  chang-
es” and “variations with minor changes” in the FIAF Cataloguing Rules for Film Archives
(1991) http://www.fiafnet.org/pages/E-Resources/FIAF-Cataloguing-Rules.html



Example:

Our herring industry (GB, 1932) is the shortened version of Drifters (GB, 1929).

Where a Work/Variant structure exists then Our herring industry would constitute a Vari-
ant of the Work Drifters.

Where no Variant structure exists then the cataloguer would decide whether it constitut-
ed a Manifestation or new Work.

It is up to every archive or institution to choose and make its own policy on whether to
use Variants or Manifestations.
