E.7.1 Film/Video or TV series/serials

On  the  surface  these  would  seem  to  be  aggregates  as  it  could  be  argued  they  are
made up of different components (episodes) brought together to make a “whole” (se-
ries/serial). However, it is not logical under the definitions of aggregates to structure and
view TV or film/video serial/series as aggregating Works.

The  starting  point  of  an  aggregate  is  the  Manifestation  “embodying  two  or  more
Works/Variants.” Each episode of a film/video or TV series/serial has its own unique in-
dividual release/broadcast Manifestation, not a single aggregate one. There was never
the original intention for all the episodes (independent individual Works/Variants) to be
released/broadcast in one single Manifestation.



A later subsequent DVD publication or digital file production may occur, warranting

an aggregate Manifestation, but this does not happen with all series/serials.

Where an institution’s cataloguing system has Work Series-Work Monographic hierar-
chy structure then the aggregate Manifestation of a DVD release/boxed set of the series/
serial, or multiple episodes from that series, could be linked as “part of” the Work Series
record.

There could then be a clarifying note on the Manifestation where necessary, i.e. to
clarify which episodes are included if the series continued with more episodes not on the
particular  aggregate  Manifestation,  or  the  aggregate  Manifestation  pertained  to  one
particular series/season within the Series.

See example below for The thick of it DVD boxed set:

The Thick of It
(Work- Serial)

The Thick of It.
The Complete Series 1-3
& Specials (DVD Manifes-
tation) (Collection Aggre-
gate)

The Thick of It. The
Complete Series 1-3 &
Specials (DVD Item)

The Thick of It. Episode 1
(Work – Monographic)

The Thick of It. Episode 1
(TV transmission)
Manifestation

The Thick of It. Episode 1
(VHS Cassette Item)

The Thick of It. Episode 2
(Work – Monographic)

The Thick of It. Episode 2
(TV transmission
Manifestation)

The Thick of It. Episode 2
(VHS Cassette Item)



Alternatively,  a  model  similar  to  E.5.1.2  Model:  Collection  Aggregate
Manifestation  within  many-to-many  Works/Variants-Manifestation
can  be  used,  whereby  a  single  Aggregate  Manifestation  links  to  the
many individual Works/Variants in “part of” relationship:

ER (Work – Serial)

ER. One Day
(Season 1, Episode 1)
(Work – Monographic)

ER. Going Home
(Season 1, Episode 2)
(Work – Monographic)

Etc.

ER. The Complete First and Second Season
(DVD Manifestation (Collection Aggregate)

ER. The Complete First and Second Season
(DVD Item)

Where this Serial Work–Monographic Work hierarchy structure does not exist, then a
new aggregating Work may be created and linked via an associated contains/contained
in relationship in line with models for any other Collection Aggregate.



Example:

ER – The Complete First
and Second Season
(Work – Monographic)

ER. Day One
(Season 1, Episode 1)
(Work – Monographic)

ER. Day One
(TV transmission Manifestation)
22/09/1994

ER. Going Home
(Season 1, Episode 2)
(Work – Monographic)

ER – The Complete First
and Second Season
(DVD Manifestation – 4 disc set)
(Collection Aggregate)

ER. Going Home
(TV transmission Manifestation)
29/09/1994

For how this might be modelled in a flat or single hierarchy system see I.7 Example 7. Ag-
gregate DVD Television Serial and Episode records in 1-level Hierarchy Models

It  is  also  possible  for  particular  individual  episodes  from  different  moving  image
series/serials to be taken and formed together into a Collection or Augmentation Aggre-
gate, in which case they would then follow the same pattern of structure as any other
such aggregate, i.e. with an aggregate Manifestation and aggregating Work record, and
associative relationship links to any existing individual Work/Variant episode records.
