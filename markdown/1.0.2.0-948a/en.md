1.0.2 Moving Image Variant (i.e., Versions)30

A  moving  image  Variant  is  an  entity  that  may  be  used  to  indicate  any  change  to
content-related characteristics that do not significantly change the overall content of
a Work as a whole. Such Variants can be produced by minor additions, deletions or sub-
stitutions to the content. As a general guideline, changes that would result in a different
content description should be treated as a separate Work rather than a Variant.

Changes that could be described as Variants are detailed below, in 1.1.2 Boundaries
between Moving Image Works and Variants , and may include the addition of subtitles,
dubbing, and editing as a result of censorship or adjustment of duration, e.g. for TV pro-
gramming. For institutions that have made a policy decision not to use the Variant, these
changes may constitute Manifestation differences.

The determination of a Variant requires human analysis, and as such is an interpreta-
tive practice. It is not always easy to establish what the Variants may be. For example, an
institution may have a television recording of a motion picture broadcast but no way of
comparing it with an original theatrical copy as to whether it has been altered in terms
of subtle censorship of content or duration

Therefore, this entity is optional. If employed, each instance of a Variant is related
to a Work and can have one-to-many relationships with instances of Manifestation(s),
Event(s), Agent(s) and Other Relation(s). If no Variant of a Work exists or is known to ex-
ist, then this entity can be omitted, connecting an instance of a Work with one or more
instances of Manifestation.
