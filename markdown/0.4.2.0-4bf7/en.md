0.4.2 Capitalisation and Articles

Some institutions render Work titles in capitals – all upper-case – as a simple typo-
graphical method of identifying these key items of information, while others only cap-
italise  the  first  letter  of  a  title,  in  accordance  with  ISBD.  Either  usage  is  permitted  by
these guidelines, although institutions may prefer to retain the conventional practice of
capitalising only the first letter of a title and any proper names as dictated by the usage
of the language in which the information is given.

Users should recognise that using all capitals may create problems in the future when
reformatting to mixed case if preferred in a new system, or when reformatting to mixed
caps for display in a web platform where mixed caps is increasingly preferred. Although
it is possible to automate the conversion of upper case to mixed caps, that automation
cannot easily manage linguistic complexities or semantic rules and exceptions such as
proper nouns, or place names. Therefore, it is recommended that an institution transi-
tion to ISBD capitalisation when and where possible.

When an “all capitals” practice is followed, institutions have the additional option of re-
ducing to lower case words which are of minor importance to the substantive title (for filing
purposes, etc.), such as sub-titles, a definite or indefinite article appearing as the first word
of a title, etc. Experience has shown that this practice can make it easier for staff in institu-
tions handling multi-lingual material to recognise, for filing purposes and interpretation, the
different significance of words that are articles in one language but not in others.

While the guidelines permit both cases, it is recommended where permitted now or in the
future, to use the conventional practice of capitalising only the first letter of a title and other
letters as dictated by the usage of the language in which the information is given. Leading
articles should ideally be placed in separate fields in keeping with the way systems are being
developed for alphabetical sorting. Alternatively some systems (for example, those contain-
ing MARC21 records) indicate the number of non-filing characters to skip in alphabetization.
