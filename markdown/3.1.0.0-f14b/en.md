3.1 Elements of a moving image Item

A  majority  of  the  physical  and  digital  description  elements  of  moving  im-
age  Items  are  intended  to  be  inherited  from  the  Manifestations,  as  they  serve  as
the  exemplars  of  Manifestations.  In  some  databases,  selection  of  a  physical  car-
rier  type  initiates  provision  of  element  fields  relevant  to  that  type  at  a  Man-
ifestation  level,  or  an  Item  level,  or  both  (e.g.  in  a  2  Level  hierarchy.  See  “Shal-
low  hierarchy  model:  2
in  0.2.1  Elements  of  description  across  Works,
Variants, Manifestations, and Items).

levels”

Ideally the information need only be recorded once irrespective of where in the data
structure an institution must place it. Therefore guidelines for the treatment of physical/
digital description elements are explained fully in the Manifestation chapter.

This chapter contains Item-specific physical/digital description elements beginning at
Section 3.1.5 (see 3.1.5 Item Specifics/Extent (e.g. physical/Digital description). For exam-
ple, properties such as Extent and Format at the Manifestation level represent the “ideal,”
and item-specific information will capture where it differs from this ideal. Only elements
that are considered Item-specific have guidelines for the recording of data. Physical/digi-
tal description elements that are considered Manifestation-specific, but which may be re-
peated at the Item level, contain hyperlinks to the relevant sections in the Manifestation
chapter.
