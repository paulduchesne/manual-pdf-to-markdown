1.1.3 Boundaries between Variants

It is possible for a moving image Variant to be modified in such a way as to create a
new Variant related to the previous one.36 The boundaries between one Variant and an-
other may be drawn on the basis of the following alterations to the content:37

Change in continuity (secondary editing)

•

revision or modification of already edited footage of completed work

Example: In 2007, some in-flight showings of The Queen (2006) distributed
to Delta and other airlines had all references to the word “God” edited out
by an overzealous and inexperienced employee.38

•

abridgements or additions to existing content

Example: a release of a dubbed film abridged or augmented

Il gattopardo (Italy, France,1963, Luchino Visconti)
Dubbed/ Abridged: The leopard, English (spoken language) -1963 – USA
– 161’ (Theatrical distribution in USA, the 20th Century Fox cut 45 minutes);
Subtitled: The leopard, English (spoken language) -1980 – USA (reinte-
grates the original running time of 187’)39.

Change in textual and spoken word aspect

•

same dialogue and/or narration rendered in different spoken, sung or written
languages

Example: a release of a foreign film (dubbed), subtitled in a different language

Die kleine und die grosse Liebe (Germany, 1938, Joseph von Backy)
Dubbed/Subtitled Variant: Il piccolo e il grande amore, Italian (spoken

language), English (subtitles) – Italy – 1938

Change in performance/performers

•

addition, removal and/or replacement of some of the contributors (e.g., cast
and/or crew), associated with a Work

Example:  The  re-dubbed  North  American  English  version  of  the  Japanese
movie,  Godzilla  2000:  Millennium  (1999),  includes  the  following  credits
unique to this Variant:40

Dubbing Director: Mike Schlesinger
Media: Cinema/TV/VHS/DVD
Dubbing Studio: Tristar Pictures/Sony Pictures Entertainment

Character

Godzilla

Yuji Shinoda

Yuki Ichinose

Japanese actor

Tristar Pictures English dub

Tsutomu Kitagawa

Takehiro Murata

Naomi Nishida

Francois Chau

Denise Iketani

If much of the original textual and spoken word material remains, most of the origi-
nal footage remains in roughly the same continuity, however abridged, and substantially
most of the contributors are the same, the existence of alterations more often than not
constitute a new Variant, rather than a new Work.
