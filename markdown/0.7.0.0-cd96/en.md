0.7 Examples

The examples given throughout the guidelines are illustrative and not prescriptive (unless
stated otherwise). They follow The Chicago manual of style22 for the sake of consistency. They
are intended to illuminate the provisions of the guidelines to which they are attached, rather
than to extend those provisions. Therefore, neither the examples nor the form in which they
are  presented  should  be  taken  as  instructions,  unless  the  accompanying  text  specifically
states that they should. Most examples are from actual titles; in the few made-up examples
an attempt has been made to formulate realistic data. Examples of complete entries may be
found in Appendix I, Examples of records containing core elements in the different levels of
hierarchy. Examples of the elements of description in different data structures are shown in
Appendix G, Elements of Description comparison. The bibliography follows ISO 690.
