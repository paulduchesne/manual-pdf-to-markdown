198  It is recognised that vocabulary lists often require frequent updates, additions or amendments. For this rea-
son, should resources permit, it would be ideal to separate value lists from the rules and locate them in a central,
online repository, like metadataregistry.org. RDF-based repositories like this can supply up-to-date vocabularies
on demand and have additional advantages over traditional value lists such as those found in this Appendix.



Monographic:  Complete  content  in  one  part  or  intended  to  be  completed  in  a  finite
number of parts.

This is also applicable to television episodes. The record for the television series itself is
catalogued as a Serial.

Examples:

Coronation Street [1960-12-09]
Spaced. Series 1 Episode 1. 1999-09-02

Serial: Content issued in successive parts and intended to be continued indefinitely, or
across a span of time. A Work record for a television series is catalogued as a “Serial.”
Individual episodes may be catalogued as a Monographic record.

Examples:

Gaumont British News (1934-)
Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars (1938)
Chemistry Essentials (1996)
Breaking Bad (2008-01-20 – 2013-09-29)

Collection: Content issued in several independent parts; an ‘umbrella’ work title covering
a number of different Works/Variants/Manifestations199.

Examples:

Pleasure (Joan Littlewood, c1963) (Footage shot on behalf of Joan Littlewood as
part of her ‘Fun Palace’ project.)

The ‘Dogme’ films (Each individually numbered.)

Shadows of progress: documentary film in post-war Britain 1951-1977

Other uses for Collection:200

Archive-acquired collections of works not originally intended for general release or broad-
cast all have component parts that form the collection as a whole, usually acquired on a
series of numerous film reels or videotapes, etc. each with an identifying title.

Examples:

David Lean home movies
William Butlin personal films
Hollywood interviews (unedited production material for series Hollywood)
BFI London Film Festival Awards 2010 – production material, etc.
Fifties  features  (videotape  collection  of  production  material,  with  each  of  the

tapes given an identifying acquisition title:
B1-3 Sylvia Syms I/V
B4-6 Sylvia Syms I/V & Jill Craigie I/V

“David Lean home movies,” “Fifties features,” etc. would be the Work titles for the
collection-level description, with Collection as its description level.

The individual components of this collection would also be created as individual
Works with Work titles at the Analytic level of description.

For example:

Egypt
India
India no.2
Kenya

These  titles  should  then  be  linked  to  the  collection-level  description  and  assigned
“part of” relationship.

Aggregate compilation videos/DVDs that are collections of individual works existing as
entities in their own right, e.g. Portrait of a miner is a DVD of various Mining review shorts
which had their own individual release as complete entities or works.

•

•

Portrait of a miner would be created as the work title, with the description
level of Collection.

Each of the Mining review Works used in Portrait of a miner would then be
linked to it and assigned a “contained in” relationship (see Appendix E.5 Mod-
elling Aggregates).

Provide a list of the compiled works contained in the Collections Work in its Synopsis or
Summary field.
