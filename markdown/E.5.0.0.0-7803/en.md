E.5 Modelling Aggregates

An aggregate is a Manifestation, but “the process of aggregating the Works/Variants
itself is an intellectual or artistic effort and therefore meets the criteria for a Work. In the
process of creating an aggregate Manifestation, an aggregating Work is produced. This
effort may be relatively minor or represent a major effort resulting in an aggregate that
is significantly more than a sum of its parts. . . The aggregating Work may or may not be
deemed important enough to be recorded.226”

An institution may therefore be able to choose whether to create a new aggregating

Work or not, although this flexibility may be restricted by other factors.

In  practical  terms  creating  aggregates  and  how  they  are  modelled,  will  be  deter-

mined by structures and capabilities of an institution’s database or other systems.

Under FRBR and CEN an aggregate Manifestation is allowed to have a many-to-many
relationship with Works/Variants, i.e., it can have a “part of” relationship with more than
one Work/Variant.

However, many database systems are structured in a way that does not allow this and
will only permit links or relationships between Manifestation records and a single Work/
Variant record at all times, i.e., a one-to-many Work/Variant-Manifestation relationship.

There are also potential implications for those organisations using international iden-
tifiers or registration numbers, e.g., ISAN gives a number to what they define “compila-
tion”: “a compilation work is a collection of two or more separate works (each identified
with its own ISAN) in a single distribution package”227.

This may have a bearing and impact on decisions relating to whether to produce an

aggregating Work or not.

The model of creating an aggregating Work is recommended. With systems that only
allow for a one-to-many Work/Variant-Manifestation relationship, then an aggregating
Work should always exist (for Collection, Augmented and Parallel Aggregates), and the
aggregate Manifestation linked as “part of” it.

In  addition,  the  multiple  independently  created  moving  image  Works/Variants  of
the aggregate should also ideally be created as separate individual Works/Variants, and
then linked in an associative relationship using “contains/contained in” terms with the
aggregating Work.

It is recognised that the ability to do this may be dependent on sufficient information
and details about the individual Works/Variants being available to create such individual
records. Where this is insufficient the titles of the individual Works/Variants making up
the aggregate may be added as alternative title types to the aggregating Work. This will
assist in accessibility and identification.

For how aggregate records may be structured in a 1-level hierarchy system see I.7 Ex-
ample 7. Aggregate DVD Television Serial and Episode records in 1-level Hierarchy Models.
Whilst this relates to a television example the same principles can be applied in the case
of film collection and augmented collection aggregates.
