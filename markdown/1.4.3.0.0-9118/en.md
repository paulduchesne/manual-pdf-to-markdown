Summary

O  Beijo  da  mulher  aranha  =  Kiss  of  the  spider  woman /  director,
Hector Babenco ; producer, David Weisman ; screenplay, Leonard
Schrader. -- BR : HB Filmes [producer], 1895 ; US Sugarloaf Films
[producer], 1985 ; US : Island Alive [distributor], 1985.

Molina, a homosexual window-trimmer convicted on a morals
charge, shares a dreary prison cell with Valentin, a clandes-
tinely-held politically active journalist who has been endlessly
tortured by prison authorities in a vain attempt to extract in-
formation about his activities. Both men could not be farther
apart in personal attitudes, lifestyles, and emotional makeup:
Molina  is  a  glib  raconteur,  who  dwells  in  a  fantasy  world  of
glamorous movies from yesteryear, of romantic screen heroes
and tragic heroines. Valentin is a self-disciplined intellectual
who is devoted to the cause of human rights and his political
concerns. [etc. ; this is an excerpt from the full record]
