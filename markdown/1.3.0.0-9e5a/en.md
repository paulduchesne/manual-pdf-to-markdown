1.3 Elements of a Work/Variant

This section describes the metadata elements that can be used to describe a Work/
Variant. It is up to each institution to choose which elements are most applicable to de-
scribe their collections and according to what their system can support.

This  Manual  recommends  using  the  qualifier  “Type”  for  several  core  elements  if  an
institution’s system can support it. In these cases, “Type” is used to define the source,
function or purpose of the value entered in the main element. Using a “Type” qualifier
conforms to its use in Dublin Core and other Dublin Core-influenced standards such as
EBUCore  and  PBCore.  Examples  of  using  “Type”  include  the  Identifier,  Title,  Date,  and
Description elements.
