1.3.4.1 Date Type

The year or date should be associated with an event in the life cycle of the Work or
its Variants (see 1.4.2 Events). If your system supports it, apply a “Date Type” qualifier to
make the date or year purpose clear. Date Type terms should be derived from a controlled
vocabulary. For a list of initial terms, see Appendix D.4 Event Types.

For Works, the date is typically related to events such as its creation, availability (i.e.,
publication,  release,  distribution,  broadcast  or  transmission)  or  registration  (e.g.,  for
copyright or intellectual property purposes).

For Variants, the date is typically related to its creation, availability, registration or
bestowal of an award (e.g. the subtitled version of a foreign language motion picture, or
a Variant of the original Work, is the entity nominated for an award).

More than one year or date may be associated with a Work or its Variants. For exam-
ple, in the case of a Work comprising segments produced in different years (for example,
a home movie); list the years, if known, e.g., 1955, 1956, 1959.55

Similarly, a Work may have a production date of 1962, a copyright date of December
1963, and a first release date of January 1964. Apply the Date Type qualifier to clarify the
purpose of each date.
