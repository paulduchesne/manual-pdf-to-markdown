D.5.6 Home viewing publication

A published Manifestation for viewing in the home or similar small-scale private con-
text, of any type of work. For example, a Blu-ray release of a feature film, for viewing in
the home; or a DVD compilation release of a set of non-fiction film works.

Example:

A day in the life. Four portraits of post-war Britain (UK, DVD/Blu-ray, 2010)

The most used formats are VHS, DVD, and Laserdisc, but this definition can also in-
clude 9.5mm Pathé Baby or 8mm packages in use from the 1950s-1980s (e.g.. the 1977
Star Wars home video in 8mm).

NOTE:  When  the  production  process  involves  changes  related  to  the  publication,
marketing, etc. (e.g., a change in publisher, a repackaging, a new distributor and so on),
the resulting product may be considered a new Manifestation as well (see 2.1 Boundaries
between Manifestations).
