A.2.4 Alternative145

Ensures that users can search under any variation of the title that has been used for
a Work, Variant, Manifestation or Item, and be led to the content or particular physical
object that they seek.

Alternative titles for the Work differ from uniform, preferred, and other title informa-
tion and may be encountered in the course of cataloguing its Variants, Manifestations
and  Items.  If  the  Work  could  reasonably  be  sought  under  the  title(s)  of  one  of  these
Variants/Manifestations, the alternative title should be indexed in such a way that a user
who searches on it is led to the Work.

Alternative titles for the Manifestation differ from the title proper or other title information.146

Alternative titles on a Manifestation can have a different nature, expressing the pos-
sible different designations of the Manifestation during its production, release, publica-
tion or archival history that may be different from the title proper or parallel titles.

Ideally record in a note the source(s) for the alternative title(s).

Some institutions may wish to name the type of alternative title. Record the Alterna-
tive Title Type by taking the most suitable term from a controlled list elaborated in-house
or referring to an authoritative existing list.

If no specific alternative title type is known, the information can be omitted.

A controlled list, not exhaustive and open to further and continued implementation,

is suggested below:

A.2.4.1 Alternative title types

•	 Working: A provisional title, given during the production or the

manufacturing process.147

•	 Acquisition title: A title under which a moving image was acquired, with no

other discernible title discovered.

•

Pre-release title: A provisional title, given to the Manifestation before the
release or publication with the definitive title of the related Work.148

145  Adapted from YCR, 1.3 Work access, p. 39.
146  The definition is based on the explanation of the “Variant title” title given in RDA (glossary and 2.3.6), but
in this case, to avoid confusion with the “Variant” entity, the term “Alternative” has been adopted. The main
reference and reason for this choice is the FIAF Glossary where “Alternative title” is in parallel with the RDA
“Variant title” and practically with the same meaning: FIAF Glossary, 2008 revision, A.1.12 “Alternative Title,
Alternative title. Any title by which a film is known other than the Original Title”.
147  Based on FIAF 1.3.

•	 Abbreviated title: A title given in order to designate it quickly by the

institution.149

•

•

Translated title: A title given to designate the Manifestation in the language
of the institution, in a literally translated form (not to be confused with the
Parallel title).150

Transliterated title: A title given to designate the Manifestation in
the alphabet of the institution, following international standards of
transliteration, such as ISO 9 (not to be confused with the Parallel title).151

•	 Corrected title: A title given in the corrected form by the institution, when it
is recorded incorrectly in the sources of information, if it is considered to be
important (either for identification or for access).152

•	 Help/Search: Titles which may or may not have been used in verified sources

but which clearly help when searching. Use the “Help/Search” title type for
stylistic variations including, abbreviations (e.g., Dr./Doctor), numerals (e.g.,
45/forty five), acronyms (e.g., FIAF/International Federation of Film Archives)
symbols and other characters (e.g., &/and, £/pound), different spelling
(Southsea/South Sea).153

•

Series/Serial title: the series/serial title of a Work that constitutes an episode/part

Example:

Mary Tyler Moore show = Series/Serial Title
Chuckles bites the dust = Preferred Title

(see 1.3.2 Title)

•

Parallel title : the title in another language or script.

In most cases, a Parallel title correlates to Variants for different language versions.

For archival moving image cataloguing, the concept of a parallel title includes any title
qualifying as a preferred title but which is not used as the preferred Work title (e.g. par-
allel titles for international co-productions, a title which cannot be reproduced) and any
title by which the Work is commonly known to users and researchers.

Parallel titles are recorded with wording and spelling as established by an appropriate
principal source. Where this involves transcription between scripts, use an appropriate
standard for transliterations.154

Example:

Chandralekha
[No English language title translation available; archive holds Indian re-
lease copy – title is romanized.]

When a title is an international co-production, or is produced in a bi- or multi-lingual
country of origin, and is released simultaneously under separate titles in the languages
of the country of origin or countries of co-production as well as in other languages, re-
cord all the parallel titles in the languages of the countries of co-production and in the
language of the copy the institution holds, if it is in an additional language.

If it cannot be determined whether the Work was released simultaneously or the re-
lease  order  cannot  be  determined,  the  cataloguer  should  select  one  of  the  qualifying
titles in accordance with a consistent policy (for example from a list of languages in the
institution’s preferred order, or by reference to an authoritative source.) 155 156

Historically, parallel titles have been placed within the title field itself, following the
preferred  title  and  an  equal  sign  to  represent  the  title  frame  (i.e.,  the  fact  that  both
titles appear onscreen). These guidelines recommend the use of separate fields that dis-
tinguish between the preferred title and any subsequent parallel title(s) but if this is not
possible, the older approach is acceptable.

Example:

Der Fangschuss = Coup de grâce
[Work is a German-French co-production. The Work was released in the U.S. under
the French title.]

Der Fangschuss
Coup de grâce

(Preferred Title)
(Parallel Title)

Alternatively, an institution may opt to have fewer Title Types and simply use Preferred

154  FIAF, 1.3. Parallel title, p. 22.
155  FIAF, 1.3.4., pp. 23-24.
156  Such lists will normally give preference to the languages most familiar to researchers in the country of the
archive. For example, the standard list for archival moving image cataloguing in the United States is:
1. U.S. title (if an American company is involved in the production).
2. U.K. title (if a British company is involved in the production).
3. Other English language title (if an English language speaking country is involved in the production).
4. French title (if a French company is involved in the production).
5. German title (if a German-speaking country is involved in the production).
6. Other Romance language title (if these language companies are involved in the production).
7. Other Germanic language title (if these language companies are involved in the production).



and Alternative Title Types (i.e., designating parallel titles as Alternative Title Types). For
example, with co-productions, a Preferred title for the Work is established with all other
language titles added both as Alternative title types to the Work and as the Title Proper/
Other Title of an associated Variant and/or Manifestation.

A parallel title of a Manifestation corresponds to the title proper in another language

or script.157

Record  in  a  note  the  source  of  the  parallel  title,  as  appropriate.  Institutions  may
choose  to  distinguish  between  distinct  Parallel  and  Alternative  title  types  or  adopt  a
wider definition of “Alternative” which incorporates both.

For parallel titles of a Manifestation distributed in distinct geographical regions, re-

cord the region(s) to which the parallel title applies.

(For the treatment of the geographical names, see Getty Thesaurus of Geographic

Names (TGN), or some other recognised standard.)
