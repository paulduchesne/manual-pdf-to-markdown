2.4.1 Agent(s)

An  Agent  for  moving  image  Manifestations  is  defined  as  an  entity  that  is  involved
in  the  exploitation  (release,  distribution,  broadcasting),  publishing,  manufacturing  or
preservation of a Manifestation and who is considered to have major responsibility for, or
be of major importance to, the Manifestation. Typical distinctions between agent types
are Person, Corporate Body, Family and Person Group.106

Work/Variant Agent(s) tend to be involved in the original creation of the Work/Vari-
ant so are not repeated in the Manifestation record. Only “new” Agents that contributed
to the Manifestation as described above are included in the Manifestation record.

Agent(s) may also have relationships to an instance of a specific Event or of an “Other”

relationship in connection with the Manifestation.

Because responsibility for moving image materials is most often complex and highly
diverse,  institutions  -  particularly  those  with  special  interests  -  should  determine  the
types of roles they wish to include. These roles may vary from institution to institution
according to the types of moving image material held. For example, an institution hold-
ing  television  material  would  probably  consider,  for  Manifestations,  the  function  of
broadcaster more important than that of distributor. The opposite would be the case for
institutions whose collections are composed of motion picture material. Provide access
to Agents when they have made an important contribution to the particular Manifesta-
tion, even when the type of responsibility (credit function) is one that may not be con-
sidered major in other Manifestations.107

In the case of aggregate Manifestations, if desirable and applicable, record multiple

instances of Agent associated with the aggregated content.

2.4.1.1 Agent Activity

Describes the activity of the Agent(s) to make explicit the relationship(s) between the

Agent(s) and the Manifestation.

Record one or more Agent activity terms, for example, “distributor,” “broadcaster,”
“broadcast channel,” etc., to express the nature of the agent’s relationship to the Ma-
nifestation. Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list,
which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.8 Manifestation Agent Types.

Choose the single most specific term in each case, if possible. If no suggested terms
apply, compose a term to describe the relationship between the creator and the Mani-
festation being catalogued. If the relationship is ambiguous, use a value to indicate this,
for example, “unknown” to indicate a person performing in a capacity that is uncertain
or not covered by typical terms.108 Optionally, when the activity performed by an Agent is
probable but not certain, provide the function name followed by a question mark.

Besides the principal Agent Activities suggested, institutions, particularly those with
special  interests,  should  create  and  apply  in-house  value  lists  of  other  specific  Agent
activities, which may vary from institution to institution.

Record in a note any additional details that cannot be expressed through controlled
terms. (e.g. “appears only in final scene”, etc.). If a name is known to be fictitious, or
requires clarification, make a note giving the actual name, etc.

For recording the attributes of Agents (e.g. first name, last name, nationality, etc.),
refer to authoritative sources such as Functional requirements for authority data: a con-
ceptual model or tools such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File.109 Optionally,
if the Agent is credited under a name that is not identical with the preferred name from
an authority file, record the name as used in the current instance of the related entity.110

Give the Agent(s) and Agent Activity in the terms and language in which they appear,
either in the sources of information or in the language of the institution, or both. If more
than one Agent is associated with a particular role connected with a Manifestation or Event,
where possible or desirable, record the names in the order indicated by the sequence, layout,
or typography of the names on the source of information. Preserving the ordering of the
credited persons should be determined by the requirements of individual institutions.111
