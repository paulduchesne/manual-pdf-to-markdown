D.7.2 Manifestation/Item Specific Carrier Type

Institutions should develop standard lists of terms to indicate the specific carrier type

or refer to authoritative existing lists.

For optical media, only add commercially produced media here. If the optical media
is  “writable”  and  is  being  used  to  store  a  digital  file,  put  the  digital  file  format  in  the
General Carrrier Type, and the optical storage media in Specific.

Examples include, but are not limited to:

YEE (http://myee.bol.ucla.edu/catrul.doc 5.3.3 (physical carriers)
AMIM2 5D, pp. 18-19 (for gauges/width values)
AMIM2 5B7, pp. 10-11 (including both “tape” and “disc” based video formats).
RDA 3.20; YEE (http://myee.bol.ucla.edu/catrul.doc 5.3.14 (for encoding formats).
PBCore  instantiationPhysical  (http://metadataregistry.org/concept/list/vocabu-
lary_id/145.html) (for physical carriers)
PBCore  instantiationDigital  (http://pbcore.org/pbcoreinstantiation/instantiation-
digital/) (for broad digital formats)

Additional  sources  of  information  include  several  SMPTE  standards,  engineering
guidelines,  and  recommended  practices.  These  are  some  of  the  most  common  terms,
but not a complete or definitive list.

For digital files, list the physical carrier on which the file is stored. For all other materials,
use this element to provide more specific information on the physical carrier.

Institutions should develop standard lists of terms to indicate the specific carrier type

or refer to authoritative existing lists.

These are some of the most common terms, but not a complete or definitive list.
