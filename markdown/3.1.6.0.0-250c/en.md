3.1.6 Access conditions

Record any information on how and to whom the moving image Item can be made
available, including details of the condition of the Item and of its treatment, preserva-
tion or restoration Events. This creates a condition and preservation history for the Item,
and is also important for assessing conservation conditions and establishing and priori-
tising collections care and preservation activities.

3.1.6.1 Item condition

Observations about conditions will typically happen in the course of an Event such as
inspection of an Item. These observations should aim to be as clear and concise as pos-
sible, avoiding abbreviations and initials, and as far as possible using controlled vocabu-
lary. For example, establish whether to use “scratched”, “scratches” or “scratch marks”
and be as consistent as possible. This enables better searching and accessibility of data.

Record these actions as an Event (see 3.3.2 Events), with the person or entity perform-

ing the action as an Agent (see 3.3.1 Agent(s)).

Ideally, elements covering information and details regarding the condition of an ac-

quired Item would include those listed below.

This could be recorded using single or multiple specific headed fields (i.e., covering Base,
Emulsion, Image, Perforations, etc.), and then sub-sections of the latter, to incorporate data
ranging from graded scales designations (either numerical or alphabetical, for example 1-5,
A-G, Perfect – Very Poor) with clear definitions of what each designation means; condition
terms selected from a controlled list; free text additional qualification or clarification in ob-
servations or comments sections; identification of technical assessor; and, dates.

Record the condition of the Item including its base and/or emulsion and/or perfora-
tions, where applicable. Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms, for ex-
ample, “brittle”, “buckled”, “tears,” etc. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaus-
tive, can be found in D.16 Manifestation/Item Condition, Preservation and Restoration.

Capture the date on which the condition of the Item was recorded (using ISO standard118).
The identification of the individual who carried out the technical assessment and has record-
ed the condition should also be given. Any names should be given in full, rather than initials
or abbreviations. As stated above, people or companies performing inspections are Agents.

Note any indication that the Item is in need of servicing prior to being accessed for use.

3.1.6.2 Item location

Item descriptions should indicate a storage location number in order to provide ac-
cess and retrieval. Movements and changes of location should also be logged in order
to ascertain the precise location of an Item at any given time. If possible, use the Item
Identifier and Identifier Type fields to note an Item’s location (see 3.1.1 Identifier).

This could be a single simple field, or could include multiple fields to reflect various
electronic package or barcode numbers that may be attached to each individual can or
container, shelf, or whatever is applicable to an individual institution.
