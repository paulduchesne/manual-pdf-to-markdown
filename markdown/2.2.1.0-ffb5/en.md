2.2.1 Manifestation Type

As  previously  mentioned,  a  Manifestation  is  defined  on  the  basis  of  two  criteria:
changes in the publication context and changes in format. The element Manifestation
Type describes the specific type of change.

The Manifestation Type is expressed by a phrase denoting the relationship between
the Manifestation and the associated Work/Variant, for example, “pre-release,” “theat-
rical distribution,” “not for release,” “original,” etc.

Record the Manifestation Type by taking the most suitable term from a controlled list. A
suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.5 Manifestation Types.

If it is impossible to determine the specific Manifestation Type the information can be

omitted or indicated by a value of “unknown.”

Statements made about Language, Format and/or Extent may have an added value
of “original” to indicate characteristics of an “original Work,” where such a concept is
required or desired.86 Associating the value of “original” with a particular Manifestation
indicates it has privileged status in relation to other possible Manifestations.
