A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles (i.e. Creating titles
for untitled/unidentified entities or production
material)

A title “made up” or assigned by the cataloguer. This is often applied to untitled or

unidentified entities or production material.

This section helps in the construction of both partially or fully supplied/devised titles

for Works, Variants, Manifestations and Items.

Partially or fully supplied/devised titles facilitate the discovery and identification of
moving images without formal title. The title itself should be descriptive, describing the
Work as succinctly as possible.158

Supplied/Devised titles are implemented for:

•	 moving image entities (i.e., WMVI) intended to have a formal title but the

title cannot be determined from any other source (i.e. moving image entities
with “no titles”)

•	 moving image entities that were not intended to have a formal title (i.e. “un-

titled” moving image entities such as home movies)

•	 moving image entities that are unidentifiable.

The moving images may be monographic, multi-part or component part. They may

also be edited, partially edited, or unedited; complete or incomplete.

157  Differences between FIAF 1992 and RDA: FIAF expands the concept of Parallel title to any title qualifying as an
original but not used as a title proper (the attempt was to include as many alternative titles as possible), but gives
to the archives the responsibility to decide whether to enter them in the appropriate area or in the Notes area. RDA
makes a distinction among the different characteristics of a title and considers the parallel title strictly as “the ti-
tle proper in another language or script”. In this context the RDA approach has been considered more appropriate.
158  Based on OLAC (2009), Part 3a, pp. 8-9.



These guidelines do not explicitly address the construction of supplied/ devised titles for
collection-level records, although the principles would be the same. For collections of material
based on the principle of provenance, refer to other standards such as General International
Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)) or Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS).

It is recognised that in real-world cataloguing, the creation of supplied/devised ti-
tles must begin with an examination of the moving images (i.e. the sound and picture)
on a Manifestation/Item.

Where appropriate, the supplied/devised title for Works and Variants will be inherited
directly from the supplied/devised titles constructed for the Manifestations/Items (i.e.,
the  “things”  under  consideration)  from  information  sourced  from  the  Manifestations/
Items alone or in combination with accompanying documentation, or secondary sources.

NOTE: The guidelines for the construction of partially or fully supplied/devised titles
have traditionally incorporated display concerns by recommending the consistent place-
ment of different components of data in the title field of a record. Current data content
standards, such as RDA, mean to separate display from content rules. These guidelines
straddle the middle by providing recommendations for concatenating data in the title
field, or allowing a more atomized way of indexing.

Additionally,  some  institutions  place  the  partially  or  fully  supplied/devised  titles  in
square or rounded brackets. Traditionally, the presence of brackets indicates informa-
tion taken from a place other than the Item being catalogued. Use the practice of your
institution. Where possible, use a Title + Title Type approach. This approach effectively
removes the need for brackets by establishing the Title is supplied/devised by the cata-
loguer. If there is no Title Type field then a Notes or other field could be utilised.

It is recommended that archive titles are devised following a pattern of:

Who/what: persons, events or objects
What: activity
Where: location
When: time period
Who/what: name of source or collection

The above elements can be combined with a form qualifier if relevant: i.e. Commer-

cial, Rushes, Interview, or Screen test, etc.

Not all the above information has to be in the archive title if not discernible, but in-

corporating as many as possible using a consistent will aid identification.

Examples:

Lawrence of Arabia. Rushes
Tram journey through Southampton 1902
Warships. 1920s
Tango. Orange genie. Commercial
Jones Collection footage. No. 5

A.2.5.1 Partially Supplied/Devised Titles159

Partially supplied/devised titles are applied in cases where the moving image content

from a Manifestation/item has:

•

a recognised form

and

•

a relationship with, or is dependent upon, a particular moving image Work or
Variant, or a multi-part Work.

Therefore, partially supplied/devised titles may be created for edited content that is a
Work in its own right (e.g. trailers or a compilation of trailers) but connected to a larger
Work; or unedited content that is derived from or otherwise has a dependent relationship
to a Work (e.g. rushes).

Partially supplied/devised titles are basically augmented preferred titles for a Work/
Variant.  This  augmentation  traditionally  appends  a  form  term  to  the  title  itself,  (e.g.,
Gone with the wind. Trailer).

Optionally, form terms may be left out of the title field and indexed as an attribute of

the Work/Variant where possible or preferable.

Partially supplied/devised titles may be provided in cases of unidentified moving im-
age content. For example, a Work may have a partially supplied/devised title in instances
where a series/serial title is known but the episode or chapter title is not (e.g., The Mighty
Boosh.  Unidentified  episode).  Unedited  footage  from  a  known,  named  television  pro-
gramme (e.g. a compilation of outtakes from 60 Minutes) is another case where a Work
may have a partially supplied/devised title.

Institutions should rely upon in-house lists of standardised form terms to be used as
additions  to/indexed  as  an  attribute  of  such  related  titles,  or  utilise  established  stan-
dardised  lists  such  as  Library  of  Congress  Genre/Form  Terms  for  Library  and  Archival
Materials (LCGFT), or rely upon the “form terms” list provided in D.18 List of form terms
for Supplied/Devised titles.

General guidelines for Partially Supplied/Devised titles160

Formulate the Partially supplied/devised title by recording in the order suggested, the
following  three  components,  in  a  manner  that  it  will  clearly  and  uniquely  identify  the
content being catalogued.

i)  The TITLE of the particular moving image Work or Variant, or multi-part Work to

which the content has a recognised form and relationship with

ee/UCLA 5.1.2; AMIM2 1F1.1
160  This section, including form terms and examples, is based on or taken from FIAF 1.4.3 Additions to titles;Y-
ee/UCLA 5.1.2; AMIM2 1F1.1




And

ii)  The FORM qualifier, e.g. Commercial, Interview, Rushes, Screentest, etc.

And/Or

iii) The NAME of Persons/Events/Objects, activity, location, time period (Who, What,

Where, When)

Optionally, associate a form term with the Work through indexing the form term in a

specific field(s).

Where applicable, more than one form term can be used, e.g., Frenzy. Promotional

film. Rushes.

If the order or the number of the components cannot be met as prescribed, option-
ally, use a local practice that presents the data in a standardised way, even if such stan-
dardised presentations must be developed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the ma-
terial itself as well as the context of an institution’s collection. A level of consistency can be
maintained by following the general principles of description laid out in these guidelines.

When there is more than one Manifestation/Item with the same supplied/devised title,
and there are no other means of further disambiguation, use a number to distinguish them.

The source(s) of information of the supplied/devised title should be made clear, wheth-
er in notes or through some other structured method for correlating data to its source(s).

A relationship between the title and the title type should be established such that the
title constructed by the cataloguer is named and identified as “supplied” or “devised,”
whether within the title itself or via a juxtaposed field such as “Title Type.” If there is no
Title Type field then a Notes or other field could be utilised.

Some archives place the entire sequence of components in the title field in brackets.

Other archives place only the qualifying form term in square or round brackets.

EXAMPLES:

Le Cercle Rouge. Theatrical trailer

OR

Le Cercle Rouge (Theatrical trailer)

OR

[Le Cercle Rouge. Theatrical trailer]

OR

Title: Le Cercle Rouge

Form: Theatrical trailer



The misfits. TV trailers

OR

The misfits (TV Trailers)

OR

[The Misfits. TV trailers]

OR

Title: The Misfits

Form: TV trailers

L’armée des ombres. Rushes

OR

L’armée des ombres (Rushes)

OR

L’armée des ombres [Rushes]

OR

Title: L’armée des ombres

Form: Rushes

Le samourai. Excerpt

OR

Le samourai (Excerpt)

OR

[Le samourai. Excerpt]

OR

Title: Le samourai

Form: Excerpt

For constructing partially supplied/devised titles where the moving image is a com-

ponent part of a known larger Work, but the title of the component part is not known:

If the content probably was released or broadcast or published with a title, but the ti-
tle is missing, supply/devise a title with the word “unidentified.” If it is known that the
content falls into a form category, add a form term as listed in the “form term” list.161

Descriptive phrases, which are short statements summarising the moving image, can
also  be  used  in  association  with  a  titled  Work,  in  conjunction  with  the  form  term.

Any further description may be added following a period, or a dash.162 For example,
the type of test (screen test), the person tested, or the particular sequence(s) in an
excerpt, may be specified in the title field where necessary or warranted.

Optionally (or additionally), this data can also be indexed in specific fields dedicated
to this content.

Use numbers to distinguish separate content when there is more than one unidenti-
fied segment in a particular descriptor category.

EXAMPLE

The Mighty Boosh. Unidentified episode

OR

Series Title: The Mighty Boosh

Episode Title: Unidentified episode

Flash Gordon conquers the universe. Unidentified episode.

OR

Series Title: Flash Gordon conquers the universe

Episode Title: Unidentified episode

This hour has seven days. Unidentified episode. International espionage. 196?

OR

Series Title: This hour has seven days

Episode Title: Unidentified episode

Summary/Content description: International espionage

Year: 196?

Heckle and Jeckle. Unidentified cartoon.

OR

Series Title: Heckle and Jeckle

Episode Title: Unidentified episode

A.2.5.2 Fully Supplied/Devised Titles

Fully  supplied/devised  titles  are  applied  in  cases  where  the  moving  image  content
from a Manifestation/Item has no formal title and a formal title cannot be established
from the entity itself or accompanying documentation, or other secondary sources.

162  The punctuation used is less important than following a consistent order and conforming to standard
terminology.



General guidelines for FULLY Supplied/Devised titles

Formulate the FULLY supplied/devised title by recording in the order suggested, the
following TWO components, in a manner that will clearly and uniquely identify the con-
tent being catalogued.

1)  The NAME of Persons/Events/Objects, activity, location, time period (Who, What,

Where, When)

AND/OR

2)  A FORM qualifier, e.g. Commercial, Interview, Rushes, Screentest, etc. [Either add-

ed as a component to the title itself, or indexed in specific field(s)]

Where ascertainable, when the content being described consists of one specific form,

supply the form using standardised vocabulary.163

Optionally (or additionally), establish a link with the form index adopted by the archive.

Institutions should rely upon in-house lists of standardised form terms, or utilise es-
tablished  standardised  lists  such  as  Library  of  Congress  Genre/Form  Terms  for  Library
and Archival Materials (LCGFT), or rely upon the list provided in D.18 List of form terms
for Supplied/Devised titles.

EXAMPLES:

Announcements
Bloopers
Commercials
Home movies

If the content being described consists of two or more forms, record the one or two
most  predominate  forms  followed  by  the  phrase  “and  other  content,”164  or  “and  other
segments” or something similar as long as consistency is achieved.

EXAMPLE:

CBS bloopers, commercials and other content

It  is  recommended  that  institutions  stipulate  within  the  supplied/devised  title  that
the  footage  is  unedited  (e.g.  “unedited  footage”  or  “unedited  content”),  as  an  overall
way of characterising the form of the content. This may not be appropriate in all cases.165

EXAMPLES:

Animals. Unedited footage
Boulder transmission line tests. Unedited footage

164  Adapted from DACS, 2.3.18, pp. 20-21.
165  Based on Yee/UCLA, 5.2.3



Cattle herd. Stock footage
Kennedy presidential campaign. Arrival, Boston. Unedited footage
Trains, night clubs, Santa Ana Freeway. Stock shots
Unedited. Kleine Collection footage
Unedited. Jones Collection footage. No. 5

Where ascertainable, supply standardised or controlled terms or phrases that most
precisely and succinctly characterise what the content is about (e.g. persons, corporate
bodies, objects, activities, events, geographical area).

Where ascertainable, record the name(s) of the person(s), family (families) or corpo-
rate body (bodies) predominately responsible for the creation, assembly, accumulation
and/or maintenance of the content.166 An agent relationship should be associated with
a Work, Variant or Manifestation/item depending on the type of contribution involved.

Record  or  index  the  name(s)  in  the  form  by  which  the  creator/collector/assembler,

etc. is generally known in natural language order.167

If no name has been recorded, but the subject of the content is a person, family or
corporate body, express the title in a way that clearly indicates that the subject of the
content is the named person, family or corporate body.168

EXAMPLES:

Compilation on Emmanuelle Devos
Early balloon footage.
World War I patriotic marches. No. 3
Ads and tours of Seattle industry
Ponselle, Rosa. Screentests.
Theodore Roosevelt. 1905 inaugural ceremony. Speeches
James Cagney, ca. 1965. Interviews

Academy Awards. Award presentation, Conrad Nagel. Unedited footage
Anna Held. Unedited footage
CBS logo reel
Eddie Cantor and others. Unedited footage
World Series, 1956. Game no. 7. Unedited footage

For unidentified moving images, use the term “unidentified” in the title. Use numbers
to distinguish separate content when there is more than one unidentified segment in a
particular descriptor category.
