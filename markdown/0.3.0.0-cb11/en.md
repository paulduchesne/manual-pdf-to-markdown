0.3 Sources of Information

Information entered in a record must be derived from a source. Acceptable sources
of information for moving image Works, Variants, Manifestations and Items include pri-
mary and secondary sources.

Primary sources include information on the actual Item itself. For example, for film
materials, titles and main production credits are transcribed from the frames usually in
the opening credits. Secondary sources include information written on containers and
reference materials.

Although primary sources are generally preferred, this manual allows for the use of
secondary sources no matter the entity, attribute or relationship described in recognition
that there may be constraints on the amount of research or viewing a cataloguer can do.

Whether information is taken from primary and/or secondary sources as listed in the
following,  indicate  that  fact  either  by  means  of  a  note  or  by  some  other  means  (e.g.,
through coding or the use of square brackets, specific fields, or links to other databa-
ses).12 Add the source of the information in a Note field and include the element name.
Cite  each  individual  source  of  information  using  an  agreed  upon,  consistently  applied
citation style, such as The Chicago Manual of Style, or other style guide.

Primary source information can be derived from:

a)  the title frame(s) or title screen(s)13

b)  embedded metadata in textual form that contains a title (e.g., metadata embed-

ded in an MPEG video file)14

c)  an eye-readable label bearing a title that is permanently printed on or affixed to

the resource (excluding accompanying textual material or a container)15

d)  accompanying material or a container issued as part of the resource itself16

e)  a container that is not issued as part of the resource itself (e.g., a box, case made

by the owner)17

f)  other published descriptions of the resource18

g)  any other available source (e.g., a reference source)19
