H.3 Rights in an Item

The rights in a moving image Item typically refer to the ownership (or transfer of own-
ership) of an object, either on a physical / analogue carrier such as a 35mm film print,
or a digital file such as a DCP / DCDM or ProRes. The transfer of ownership (sometimes
referred to in legal terms as ‘transfer of title’) is important for an archive to document,
as it establishes legal ownership of the collection.

Typically, the transfer involves a contract, deed or agreement signed by both parties to
certify that ownership of the object is transferred to the archive, and often this is a com-
plex legal document. It is recommended therefore that the cataloguer capture the essential
metadata elements below, and where feasible they should associate the catalogue record
with an electronic version of the contract, by capturing filename / link to that document.



It should be understood that ownership of the Item does not imply any rights to exploit
the Work, as outlined in the Manifestation section (for example, to digitise the object
and display online, or distribute to cinemas); and it certainly does not imply any change
in the intellectual property rights in the work itself. However, often during acquisition
decision-making, an archive will undertake research into the broader rights context: is
the work in or out of copyright?; if it is, who owns that copyright?; if they are unknown
can it be considered an orphan work?; has it been registered as such?; if it is not an or-
phan work?, who owns the exploitation rights in the relevant territories, platforms? Cat-
aloguers should therefore consider capturing details of this rights check activity when
documenting the transfer of ownership of the item.

Particular acquisition agreements between object owner and archive may enforce re-
strictions on the archive, preventing them from undertaking certain activities on the item
(for  example,  preventing  them  from  digitising  the  item  for  preservation,  or  preventing
them from exhibiting the item in internal cinema). Any such restrictions should be cap-
tured in a ‘Provisos of acquisition’, ‘Conditions of access’ or ‘Conditions of reproduction’ set
of fields, as outlined below. In addition, the acquisition agreement may enforce a protocol
for disposal of any objects which are not ultimately accessioned into the archive’s perma-
nent collection: for example, disposal may require approval by acquisition source.

However, it is important to note that any acquisition agreement or contract must not
undermine the archive’s rights under law. For example, in the UK, under recent legislative
changes (Copyright Exceptions) a moving image archive has the right to ‘copy works for
archiving and preservation reasons if they are part of a permanent collection and it is not
reasonably  practicable  to  purchase  a  replacement’  (from  https://www.gov.uk/govern-
ment/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/375956/Libraries_Archives_and_
Museums.pdf). Therefore a specific acquisition agreement could not attempt to prevent
that right to copy for preservation.

In the United States, an archive’s right to copy for access and preservation is covered
under Section 108. However, this section only applies to archives and libraries with spe-
cific qualifications.248 The current Register of Copyrights has set revising Section 108 as
one of her priorities.249

In Italy, since 2004, the Cineteca Nazionale can legally use the copies acquired by le-
gal deposit (3 years after the deposit), or by copying/printing for cultural and non-profit
purposes by way of derogation from copyright law.

Below, a set of properties are recommended for describing the rights around the Ac-

quisition, and separately around the Loan, of moving image items.
