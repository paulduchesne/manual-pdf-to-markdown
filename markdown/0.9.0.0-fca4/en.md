0.9 Alternatives and options

Certain  of  the  individual  guidelines  or  parts  of  guidelines  in  this  manual  are  intro-
duced  by  the  words,  “alternatively”  or  “optionally.”  Optional  provisions  arise  from  the
recognition that different solutions to a problem and differing levels of detail and speci-
ficity are appropriate in different contexts. Some alternatives and options should be de-
cided as a matter of cataloguing policy for a particular catalogue or archive and should
therefore be exercised either always or never. Other alternatives and options should be
exercised case-by-case. It is recommended that all institutions which undertake cata-
loguing distinguish between these two types of options and keep a record of their policy
decisions and of the circumstances in which a particular option may be applied.

The  necessity  for  judgment  and  interpretation  by  the  cataloguer  is  recognised  in
these guidelines. Such judgment and interpretation may be based on the requirements
of a particular catalogue or upon the use of the items being catalogued. The need for
judgment is indicated in these guidelines by phrases such as “if appropriate,” “if import-
ant” and “if necessary.” These indicate recognition of the fact that uniform regulation of
catalogues is neither possible nor desirable, and encourage the application of individual
judgment based on specific local knowledge. This statement in no way contradicts the
value of standardisation. Such judgments must be applied consistently within a particu-
lar context and must be documented by the individual archive.

In addition, adherence to these structures and standards may not be wholly appropri-
ate or possible for some institutions, given the differences in current practice, available
cataloguing tools, and other issues. An attempt has been made to design guidelines that
can be applied where feasible, but which are not meant to be prescriptive.
