3.1.2.1 Title Type

Items can have more than just the title transcribed from the opening credits. There
can be title information written on leader, cans, and video containers. Sometimes this
information is different to what is in the credits; sometimes it is the only source of infor-
mation to help identify an Item’s content.

Note  the  source  of  title  information.  For  Items  where  the  only  title  information
is found on a can or leader, use an Acquisition Title Type(s) (see A.2.4.1 Alternative title
types) or descriptive words such as “Title on can” or “Title on leader.”
