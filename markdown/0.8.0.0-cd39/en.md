0.8 Errors

As these guidelines recognise the importance of researched information in the cata-
logue entry, unintentional errors or inaccuracies from the Item should not be reproduced
at the Work or Variant levels.

Begin with what the source of information says and correct it only when it is known
to be ambiguous or erroneous. Correction must be done in such a way that the resource
remains  recognisable  to  the  users  unaware  of  the  error.23  For  example,  AACR2  recom-
mends transcribing the error followed by “sic” and sometimes the correct text in square
brackets.

Example:

Title (Work):  À bout du souffle
Title (Item):  À bout du souflee [sic]

OR

Title (Work):  À bout du souffle
Title (Item):  À bout du souflee [souffle]

In RDA, the title is provided as transcribed without a recognition of the misspelling,
with the correct title added in a secondary set of Title and Title Type fields (see A.2.4.1
Alternative title types) and a Note explaining the misspelling.
