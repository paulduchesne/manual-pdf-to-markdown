H.3.1.2 Acquisition

See also D.4.9 Acquisition

This section is drawn from BFI policies.

1. Internal staff contact name: Captures the name of the staff member responsi-
ble for progressing and completing the agreement.

2. Agreement status: Captures the current stage in the completion of the agreement.

a. In progress

b. Hardcopy agreement sent

c. Signed hardcopy agreement received

d. Completed

3. Agreement completion date: Captures the date from which the agreement is
considered as having legally come into effect e.g. the latest date recorded on a
signed hardcopy of an Acquisition agreement.

4. Acquisition method: Denotes the form of acquisition represented by the record,
e.g.  a  donation,  a  bequest  left  in  the  will  of  a  benefactor,  or  an  internally  pro-
duced off-air recording.

a. Bequest

b. Commission

c. Donation

d. Off-air recording

e. Purchase

f. Unknown

5. Acquisition source: Represents the person or institution through which the BFI is
receiving the acquisition. Where possible, this should take the form of a link to a
record within the archive’s Persons and Institutions authority dataset.

6. Acquisition source type: Qualifies the relationship between the Acquisition and
the Acquisition source – i.e. is the acquisition source the legal owner of the item,
or are they the authorised agent of the owner acting on their behalf such as in the
case of a bequest or purchase through auction.

a. Item Owner

b. Agent

7. Acquisition source contact details: Captures the contact details of the acquisi-
tion source, primarily their postal address. Alternatively, where possible, this could
be captured in the associated Person and Institution record.



8.  Acquisition  purchase  price:  Captures  the  price  paid  for  the  purchase  of  the
complete acquisition as a integer.

9.  Acquisition  funding  source:  Captures  the  source  of  acquisition  funding.  This
could represent funding secured through an external organisation, benefactor, or
an internal budget.

10.  Acquisition  purchase  currency:  Qualifies  the  content  of  the  Acquisition  pur-
chase price field with the currency of the purchase. Suggest using 3-character ISO
4217 codes.

11. Initial rights check status: Indicates the status of initial rights checks required
as part of the acquisition process.

a. Rights holder(s) recorded in Work record

b. Rights holder is Acquisition source

c. Rights holder could not be identified

12. Acquisition date: Captures the date on which the agreement was signed – this
is the date on which the agreement becomes legally binding. In some context, in-
stead of this signature date, archives capture the date on which the Item physically
entered the premises / infrastructure of the archive. Using this ‘entry date’ can be
problematic, as items can arrive onsite before agreement is signed, or can arrive
without any form of signature or indeed knowledge that it is in transit i.e. receipt
of an unsolicited deposit. Therefore it is recommended to use the signature date.

13. Accession date: Captures the date on which the Item formally entered the col-
lection of the archive. Often this definition is dependent on formal documentation
within the archive’s collections management system, with a unique accession ref-
erence / identifier assigned.

14. Acquisition rationale: Text field or controlled field allowing the staff responsible
for the acquisition to capture the rationale behind the acquisition in relation to
the archive’s published collecting policy or other formal governance model.

15. Acquisition authoriser: Captures the name of the senior member of staff who
approves the acquisition in question.

16. Acquisition authorisation date: Captures the date that the acquisition was ap-
proved by a senior member of staff.

17. Acquisition provisos: Captures any provisos or clauses agreed with the acquisi-
tion source e.g any form of access/publication embargo. Note that this should not
undermine the archive’s rights under law. This may be captured using a text field,
or it may be controlled. And if required, it may be broken out into specific proviso
areas as in 18 and 19 below.

18. Conditions governing reproduction: Text field or controlled field to capture spe-
cific restrictions on the archive’s ability to copy the item in the analogue or digital
domain, for preservation or other purposes. Note that this should not undermine
the archive’s rights under law.

19. Conditions governing access: Text field or controlled field to capture specific
restrictions on the archive’s ability to offer internal or external access to the item,



for  research  or  commercial  purposes.  Note  that  this  should  not  undermine  the
archive’s rights under law.

20.  Provisos  expiry  date:  Captures  the  date  upon  which  the  associated  proviso
expires, if at all – e.g. the end of a publication embargo.

21. Item reproduction requested: Captures whether the supply of a duplicate copy
to the acquisition source is one of the terms of acquisition agreed with the acqui-
sition source.

22. Item reproduction terms: Captures the terms under which reproduction of the
acquired material will be supplied to the Acquisition source.

a. Reproduction at Acquisition source expense

b. Reproduction at mutually agreed expense

c. Reproduction at archive’s expense

23. Item reproduction notes: Field to allow the terms of reproduction to be further
qualified, e.g. the exact division of mutually agreed expense for reproduction.

24. Terms of disposal for unaccessioned items: Records the agreed method of dis-
posal for material not being accessioned into the archive’s permanent collections,
as authorised by the Acquisition source.

a. Return to acquisition source

b. Transfer to another institution

directory within the organisation’s infrastructure.

2. Lender: Represents the person or institution from which the archive is receiving
the loan. Where possible, this should take the form of a link to a record within the
archive’s Persons and Institutions authority dataset.

3. Lender type: Qualifies the relationship between the Lender and the Acquisition
source – i.e. is the lender the legal owner of the item, or are they the authorised
agent of the owner acting on their behalf.

a. Item Owner

b. Agent

4.  Lender  contact  details:  Captures  the  contact  details  of  the  lender,  primarily
