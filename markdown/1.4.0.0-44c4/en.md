1.4 Relationships of a Work/Variant
(links/associations with other entities/records)

A relationship associates an instance of a Work/Variant with another instance of an
entity. Entities are described in subsequent sections, but examples of entities are people or
companies associated with a Work/Variant (eg, studio, director, cast), events (copyright
registration), subjects (other Works/Variants are about the same subject), and records.

Relationships can be implemented in many ways, depending on the purpose, the mod-
elling paradigm, or architectural constraints of the chosen platform. These guidelines are
intended to be data structure neutral.70 Therefore, these guidelines cannot prescribe ex-
actly how to demonstrate relationships. Instead they recommend that certain relation-
ships be established without instruction on how precisely those links be made manifest,
i.e., whether by physical associative record linking or “see also” text conventions.

A Work may have relationships with the following:

•	 Agent(s)
•
Event(s)
•
Subject(s)/Genre(s)/Form(s)
•
Variant(s)
•	 Manifestation(s)
•	 Other (including other Works)
