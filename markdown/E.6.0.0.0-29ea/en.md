E.6 Credits (i.e. Agents) for Aggregates

An institution may choose only to add the credits relating to the aggregating Work
itself, especially where associative “contains/contained in” relationship links exist, and
credits can be found on those associated individual records. Alternatively, it may choose
to add the credits for all the component Works and the aggregating Work to the aggre-
gating Work record.
