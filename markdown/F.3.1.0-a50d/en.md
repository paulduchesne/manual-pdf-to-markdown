F.3.1 Entities

Functional  Requirements  for  Bibliographic  Records  (FRBR)  was  published  in  1998
by the International Federation of Libraries Association. It is based on the entity-attri-
bute-relationship  model  of  analysis,  and  has  been  incorporated  into  the  structure  of
both RDA and EN 15907.

FRBR identifies and defines three groups of entities:230

•	 Group 1 (products of intellectual or artistic endeavor)

	 Work
	 Expression
	 Manifestation
	 Item

•	 Group 2 (responsible for content, production, or custodianship of Group 1 entities)

	 Person
	 Corporate Body

•	 Group 3 (may serve as subjects of Group 1 entities)

	 Group 1 and 2 entities
	 Concept
	 Object
	 Event
	 Place

230 FRBR Final Report, pp. 12-16; Taylor, p. 4.



This manual focuses almost exclusively on the Group 1 entities, their attributes and re-
lationships. Although it also briefly provides guidelines for the description of the Group 2
and Group 3 entities, we recommend the use of other manuals and appropriate existing
national or international standards for more detail in these areas.
