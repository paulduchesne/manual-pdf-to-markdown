0.2.1 Elements of description across Works,
Variants, Manifestations, and Items

This section includes sample structures for how the elements can be applied across
Works,  Variants,  Manifestations,  and  Items.  Four  models  are  provided,  beginning  with
the  more  complete  four-level  model  and  ending  with  a  simple  one-level  model.  Mod-
els  should  be  applied  according  to  an  institution’s  system  and  also  determined  by  the
amount of information known about an Item.

The full list of elements of description for each entity is set out in the following charts
and diagrams, and in Chapters 1-3. See Appendix I, Examples of records containing core
elements in the different levels of hierarchy for examples of real records which contain
these core elements (as well as others) across the hierarchies.

11  Form = Fiction, Non-fiction, etc. Some institutions may incorporate these as a genre term, whilst others
may have them as a separate category to genre.
