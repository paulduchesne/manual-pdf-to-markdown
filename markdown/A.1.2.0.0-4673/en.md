A.1.2 Reflecting graphics of on-screen Titles

For graphics reasons, many moving image titles appear on screen all in capitals (e.g.
‘ALIEN’, ‘LAWRENCE OF ARABIA’), or all in lower case (e.g. ‘archipelago’) and some are
mixed (‘ORANGES and SUNSHINE’, ‘young Hearts Run Free’).

It may be important to your institution to differentiate between a graphics decision
and a linguistic decision. In some cases, the filmmakers specify that a title is meant to
be written a certain way, and in those cases you may choose to follow the filmmakers’
wishes  (e.g.  ‘sex,  lies  and  videotape’  is  not  capitalised;  ‘GoodFellas’  takes  a  capital  ‘F’
though the word is all capitals on screen.)128
