1.3.3 Country of reference

Where  known  and  applicable,  record  the  geographic  origin  of  the  moving  image
Work/Variant.  This  should  be  the  country  or  countries  where  the  principal  offices  or
production facilities of the production company or companies are located.49 Where an
official  national  certificate  or  designation  of  a  Work  exists,  use  this  as  the  authorita-
tive source, e.g., Italian government department designates what is officially an Italian
film.50 When more than one place is associated with a Work/Variant, choose the place(s)
with primary importance.

For institutions who need or require specific ordering of country of reference then the

following is a possible example of how this may be achieved.51

If the Work is a multi-national production, the countries added to the record should
be in order of financial involvement. For example, an Austrian/Italian/French co-produc-
tion  where  the  Austrian  production  company/sponsors  financed  60%,  the  Italian  25%
and the French 15% then the order of the countries would be: Austria, Italy, France.

If  it  is  not  possible  to  establish  clearly  the  financial  percentages  of  each  country’s
involvement, then consider the nationality of the director of the title and/or the majority
of personnel involved with the film and select that as being the main country of origin
of the film.

If the production company has branches in more than one country, choose the one

responsible for the production of the work.

If  the  Work  is  a  multi-national  production,  with  production  companies  in  multiple

countries, choose the predominant production company if known.

Record  the  country  of  origin  using  the  full  form  of  the  country  name,  e.g.  United
Kingdom rather than UK, by taking the most suitable value(s) from a controlled list. This
can be an in-house list but the use of a standard list such as ISO 316652 is preferable. If
ISO is used, apply the English Short Name that is associated to a code. Optionally, record
the country code as found in ISO 3166-1-alpha 2.

If the country name has changed, record the name of the country as it was at the
time of production, e.g., Czechoslovakia for a Work/Variant produced in 1970, but Czech
Republic or Slovakia for one from 2012.53

50  The certification of “Italian nationality” is provided by the law/decree 2004, n. 28, part. 5 (but already
provided in the former law 1213/1965). According to the 2004 law, the biggest part of the cast and crew, the
locations, and the technical facilities have to be Italian, and 30% of the budget has to be spent in Italy. There is
a number of exceptions for artistic reasons and in case of co-productions.
