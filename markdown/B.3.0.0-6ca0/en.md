Title of work is clearly, Ten nights in a bar room; however, several versions of this film
were produced between 1910-1931. It is probable that this work is the 1921 version, but
due to vagueness of available plot summaries and disappearance of copyright de-
scriptive material for the 1921 version, date cannot be verified at this time.190
