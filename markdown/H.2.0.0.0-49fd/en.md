H.2 Rights in a Manifestation

The rights in a Manifestation are typically licences, contracts or agreements between
the Work’s copyright owner / intellectual property rights owner, and a third party, en-
abling that third party to exploit the work legally by copying it, distributing, broadcast-
ing or publishing it, extracting from it, incorporating it in another work, etc.

Typically, a Work’s owner can offer multiple licences to multiple parties to exploit the
work in different publication territories, publication formats, publication platforms; and
typically the licence can be exclusive or non-exclusive (in other words, multiple parties
can be granted similar exploitation rights to the same work at the same time). Finally,
the licence typically states a date range within which the exploitation can take place,
with the extreme (and rare) example being ‘in perpetuity’, enabling the licensee to ex-
ploit the work within the terms without an end date.

Examples of publication modes or platforms and other exploitation models which are
often used in moving image Manifestation licences: Theatrical, Home Video, Television,
VOD (Video on Demand), DTO (Download to Own), Educational, B2B (Business to Busi-
ness) footage sales, Plane/Ship/Hotel.(see D.5 Manifestation Types).

Often an exploitation of a moving image Work in a particular Manifestation requires
the  licensee  to  obtain  additional  clearances  from  third  parties,  as  these  ‘underlying
rights’  (eg  music,  performers,  stills)  exist  in  parallel  to  the  core  intellectual  property
rights in the moving image Work. Depending on the context, and the importance of this
information for the institution, the cataloguer may consider capturing the clearance of
these underlying rights, as previously described in H.1.1.6.

Finally, where an archive holds copyright / intellectual property rights in a work, that
archive may itself grant licences to third parties to exploit the work. This situation, where
the  archive  supplies  permission  or  licence  to  another  party  to  exploit  a  work,  is  often
referred to as ‘rights out’ or sales – the opposite of ‘rights in’ or acquisitions, meaning
the archive obtains an exploitation licence from the owner. In that case, the cataloguer
should  document  not  only  rights  in  but  also  rights  out:  name  and  contact  details  for
licensee, territories, platforms, date ranges, exclusive or non-exclusive.



Given the context above, it may be useful for an archive to capture whether it is an
acquirer of the manifestation rights being documented, a granter of the rights, or simply
a documenter of the rights.
