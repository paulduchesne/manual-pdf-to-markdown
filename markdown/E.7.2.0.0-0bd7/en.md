E.7.2 Newsreels and TV news/current affairs pro-
grammes

These also do not constitute aggregates.

The  nature  of  news/newsreels  is  that  the  different  stories  do  not  constitute  “inde-
pendently created Works/Variants” and are more akin to multi-component moving im-
ages (see Section E.2.2), in that each component is meant to create the whole via filmed
links that are an integral planned part and structure of an original single Work concept.

The process of creation of these is with one whole programme in mind made up of
different filmed elements – the same as planned different location shooting (and crews)
of different scenes in a feature film that are then edited together to create the whole.
It  is  never  envisaged  that  the  individual  news  stories  would  ever  have  an  independent
individual release/broadcast on their own.

The same principles hold true for film newsreels.

Similarly,  many  early  current  affairs  TV  programmes  were  designed  as  “magazine”
programmes  featuring  a  balanced  mix  of  stories  (often  serious  and  light  mix).  These
stories also are not “independently created Works/Variants” but filmed by regular crews
and personnel associated with a particular current affairs programme, with an overall
editorial creative decision and intent of them being one component of a whole individual
Work. The “whole” would then have a Transmission Manifestation. The component parts
do not.

It  is  possible  that  only  individual  components  of  newsreels/news  programmes  may
be acquired by an institution. In such cases it is simply a matter of a partial/incomplete
acquisition, in the same way that only 2 reels of a 3 reel feature film might be acquired.
The acquisition Item record would be linked as “part of” the whole Manifestation (link to
existing newsreel example in Titling section re. this).
