A.2.2 Title Proper

The title of a moving image Manifestation or Item. This is a transcribed element, re-

flecting the title as it appears onscreen.

Manifestations

The title proper corresponds to that of the Manifestation of a Work/Variant, i.e. the
title used for a theatrical 35mm release, the title used for a DVD release, the title used for
a Television broadcast, the title used for an Internet release, etc. It may reflect the title
used in secondary sources or the title as viewed by the cataloguer from a moving image
Item belonging to the considered Manifestation. It is the chief name of any Manifesta-
tion and represents the primary access point.137

Ideally record in a note or dedicated field the source of the title proper.

If it is impossible to determine the title proper or if the Manifestation is the embod-
iment of a Work not intended to have a formal title, construct a supplied/devised title
(see A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles).

Specify  in  a  note  or  dedicated  field  if  the  title  proper  is  not  determinable  or  if  the

Manifestation embodies a Work not intended to have a formal title.

Ascertaining the Title Proper of Items differs from ascertaining those for Works, Vari-
ants and Manifestations in that what is on or affixed to the Item or physical copy itself
takes precedence.

The title of an Item may differ, either slightly or wholly, from the title of the Mani-
festation and/or Work/Variant to which it is linked hierarchically. In particular, where an

137  In this FRBR-based context, the title of a moving image Manifestation corresponds strictly to the tradi-
tionally ISBD concept of “title proper”. Vice versa, in the previous FIAF Rules the title proper was defined as “the
title of the original release in the country the origin”, which, in a FRBR-based approach, corresponds to the
“preferred title” of a Moving Image Work.

incomplete physical product of the Manifestation has been acquired (see A.2.6.3 Analyt-
ics/Components of identified newsreels/cinemagazines).

If it is not possible to establish a title from either the Item or its container then sec-

ondary sources or a supplied/devised title can be used.

Titles should be transcribed in accordance with the cataloguing guidelines and stylis-

tics applied to Works/Variants and Manifestations.

Items may also have title-like information on film leader, cans, and containers.

Ideally, the title proper of an Item is determined by the following:

i)  The title frame or frames, or title screen or screens, or title that is permanently

printed on, affixed to, or embedded in the resource.

ii)  If the resource contains none of (i), then use any label bearing a title that is
physically affixed to or within the container of the item, or printed on accom-
panying textual material.

iii) In the absence of either (i) or (ii), and if catalogued within a WVMI structure,
then replicate the title of the Manifestation to which the Item will be linked.

iv)  In  the  absence  of  either  (i)  or  (ii),  and  either  not  catalogued  within  a  WVMI
structure, or Work and Manifestation have not yet been identified, then a sup-
plied/devised  title  should  be  created.  In  the  latter  instance,  any  subsequently
created Work and Manifestation to be linked to the Item record should have the
same title and a supplied/devised title type (See A.2.5 Supplied/Devised Titles).
