D.7 Manifestation/Item Physical Description

Many of the physical description elements are considered specific to Manifestations
and are inherited properties of the Items associated with the Manifestations. This ap-
proach is recommended where possible so that the data only need be captured once in
order to eliminate redundancies. However, it is understood that many elements may be
repeated at the Item level due to systems designs. Therefore, the list of elements below
indicates those that can be conceivably recorded at the Manifestation level only, at the
Manifestation or Item level, and at the Item level only.
