1.3.6 Content description (synopses, shotlists, etc) 59

Write a concise, objective, non-critical summary of the content of the moving image
Work and/or Variant. Content descriptions can be synposes, brief TV guide-like one sen-
tence description, shotlists, etc. There can be more than one type of content description
in the record.

The  content  description  should  be  written  in  a  style  that  is  easy  to  read.  It  should
not  include  technical  terms,  abbreviations,  or  allusions  significant  to  a  specialist  au-
dience.  Avoid  slang  expressions  and  colloquialisms  fashionable  at  the  time  of  writing,
and,  where  several  cataloguers  are  viewing  independently,  they  should,  ideally,  try  to
achieve a common written style. Descriptions should be objective and not include sub-
jective commentary on the quality of the content. If acceptable summaries are already
available in secondary sources, cataloguers may use these, instead of taking the time to
prepare summaries of their own.60 If using summaries exactly as written, put the sum-
mary in quotes and note the source of the summary.

Example61

An historical drama set in 16th century England in which King Henry VIII divorces
his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and marries Anne Boleyn, a former lady-in-waiting,
who is in love with Sir Thomas Wyatt. After several years, Henry becomes infatu-
ated with Lady Jane Seymour and arranges to have the innocent Anne found in a
compromising situation with Sir Thomas. Anne is tried for infidelity, found guilty,
and executed.

Example

Donald Graham, millionaire ex-convict, plans revenge on society
figure John Cabin Brand, whom he blames for the death of his daughter.

A content description may also be a shotlist or listing of the contents of an aggregate

Work/Variant (see Appendix E, Aggregates).

Title: Magnificent Reproductions of the Great Yorkshire Show in Bradford (1901)

Mitchell  &  Kenyon  641:  Panning  shot  across  a  road  to  the  Yorkshire  Agricultural
Society  building  with  a  diffuse  crowd  of  people  in  front  of  the  building.  As  the
shot passes the building, a number of people can be seen sitting down, including
mothers with babies and some older people (00.36). Cut to a close-up shot of the
building, with a sign reading “The Yorkshire Agricultural Society. Established 1837”
(00.45). Cut to a horse-drawn cart spraying some sort of liquid on the path as it
moves along. Lettering on the back of the cart reads “Bradford City Council no.
30”  (00.58).  Cut  to  wide  steps,  with  a  number  of  smartly  dressed  men  walking
down  them  (presumably  entering  the  show)  (01.14).  Cut  to  a  shot  of  the  blades
of a windmill as they turn (01.23). Cut to a general shot of the show, with crowds
and various stalls (02.07). A marquee in the background has the sign “R. Hornsby
& Sons Ltd., Grantham”. Another sign reads “Marshall. Sons & Co.”. Chimneys and
houses can be seen in the background (02.27min).

The content description can be based on a viewing of the work, accompanying docu-

mentation, or secondary sources, but the source should be clearly noted.

For unedited Works, where time and resources permit, each scene should be summa-
rized. If there are shots of particular significance or interest – of, for example, prominent
people or places – these should be recorded. Otherwise a general description of scenes
and sequences will suffice.63

If applicable, add information about the content of the moving image Variant where

it differs from the content of the Work.
