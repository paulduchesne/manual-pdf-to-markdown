D.5.1 Pre-Release

A moving image Manifestation type that may be used to represent any embodiments
of a moving image Work that exist before the finalisation or release of the moving image
Work.  Also  use  for  partially  realised  projects,  i.e.  productions  that  started  filming  but
then project ceased before completion.

It  applies  to  production  material  in  general,  including:  original  shooting  elements
(i.e. original camera negative, working print, original video, editing file) and/or the first
recording/mixing of the sound (separate original soundtracks – dialogues, sound, music,
– or the first mixed soundtrack).

It  may  also  include,  censorship  submission  prints,  working  assembly  prints,  rushes,
costume tests, lighting tests, make-up tests, etc. where an institution may need or prefer to
group together all production material, i.e. an institution may usually create rushes and tests
as separate individual associated records but, where these are acquired as part of a large
collection of production material for one particular moving image it prefers, for practical
reasons, to keep records together for ease of access or for restoration work purposes.

It may also be used for initial record creation purposes prior to material being viewed
and catalogued, which may then result in separate Work/Variant records for Rushes and
Tests material to which the Manifestation record will link.

Example:

Something’s got to give (Rushes)

Beauty jungle: Artist Test – Shirley Ann Field

Also applied to moving image Manifestations assembled for submission to censorship/
ratings bodies, or moving image Manifestations with cuts resulting from those censorship
activities.

Detail on the specific nature of the Pre-Release Manifestation (e.g. censorship cuts,
working assembly edit, etc.) can be added as a property of the Manifestation Type, from
controlled vocabulary or free text, as preferred.

Manifestation Types can represent a unique instance (e.g. the original negative, the
first recording/mixing of the sound, censorship cuts, the working assembly edit, etc.) or,



more than one instance.

Examples:

Censorship submission print
Censorship cuts
Make-up tests
Costume tests
Screen tests general
Camera negative
Assembly edit
Rushes/Dailies
Sound mixes

These describe the context, not the format. For example, a censorship print may exist

as multiple Items (35mm print, ProRes, MP4)

Some  of  these  could  also  be  achieved  by  creating  separate  Works,  rather  than

capturing these as Manifestations of the film work.
