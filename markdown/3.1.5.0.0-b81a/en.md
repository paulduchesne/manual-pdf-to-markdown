3.1.5 Item Specifics/Extent (e.g. physical/Digital
description)

All  moving  image  Item  descriptions  should  contain  details  of  the  physical/digital

characteristics of the Items, their location, treatment and condition.

Institutions  with  archival  moving  images  need  to  describe  their  holdings  accurate-
ly for preservation, copying and reconstruction purposes. Often there will be physically
separate Items, for example image, track, music, different colour bases, etc., which are
all essential parts of a single moving image.116 Descriptive terminology covering all areas
of physical description and attributes should be established in controlled lists of terms,
to be applied in the relevant categories. The range of these and what they are can be
established  in-house  or  utilising  an  established  list,  for  example,  the  FIAF  Glossary  of
Technical Terms.

Each  Item  should  have  its  own  description,  whether  the  physical/digital  character-
istics between Items differ in one way or another, for example, in length, gauge, base,
sound, etc., or, the Items acquired are duplicate identical copies.

Institutions may record as much technical information as they wish or need, but the
Physical  and  Digital  Description  elements  of  an  Item  should  ideally  consist  of  the  ele-
ments listed in the sub-sections below where discernible.

Further data relating to the condition, preservation, location, and, acquisition, ac-
cessioning,  and  source  of  the  Item  are  also  recommended  elements  for  the  Item  (see
3.1.6 Access conditions).

These may be either added to the Item description itself or, where this is not possible,

related to other separate files or databases, via physical link or text indication.

3.1.5.1 Carrier Type

Carrier type is the medium on or the encoding format in which the Item is fixed.

Its description consists of a general carrier type, which describes the basic proper-
ties of the Item’s physical format, for example, film, video tape, digital file, etc., and a
specific carrier type, which corresponds to the gauge, in case of films and tapes, and for
digital files, to the physical carrier on which the file is stored.

116  See The FIAF Cataloguing Rules for Film Archives (1991). 5. Physical Description. Introduction



3.1.5.1.1 General Carrier Type

The broad media type of the Item (e.g., film, video, audio, optical, digital file). Re-
cording this high-level information will enable simple searching for only film, video, digi-
tal, etc. elements rather than searching by all possible formats and carriers.

Record only if this information is not captured at the Manifestation level or if required

at the Item level by the system in use.

A suggested list can be found in D.7.1 Manifestation/Item General Carrier Type.

For reasons of clarity and to avoid redundancy, optionally, institutions can decide to
skip the general carrier type description for film and video, since it is already implicit in
the specific carrier type.

3.1.5.1.2 Specific Carrier Type

Record the specific carrier type, by indicating

1)  For film and video: the width of the film stock or of the magnetic tape on which

the Item is fixed;

2)  For digital files: The physical carrier storing the digital file.

For digital files, it is most important for users to immediately identify the file contain-
er or wrapper (MXF, MOV, DPX, etc.) rather than the physical media on which it is stored.
Physical media storing a file can change, but that does not necessarily mean that the
file format has changed. It is the digital file format that is the important distinguishing
factor. Information on the specific codecs and resolution are captured in other Item el-
ements.

For optical media, only add commercially produced media here. If the optical media
is “writable” and is being used to store a digital file, put the digital file format in the gen-
eral carrrier type, and the optical storage media in specific media type.

Record the specific carrier type, selecting from a suitable controlled list. A suggested
list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.2 Manifestation/Item Specific
Carrier Type.

3.1.5.2 Item Status

Description of the preservation or access status of the Item, for example Master, View-
ing, etc. Select term from a controlled list. A suggested list, which is open and not ex-
haustive, can be found in D.7.3 Item Preservation/Access status.

3.1.5.3 Sound

Technical specifications relating to the fixation of sound in a moving image Manifes-



tation/Item  (see  2.3.4.3  Sound  characteristics  of  a  moving  image  Manifestation).  This
element  is  for  high-level  description  of  sound  on  the  item;  i.e.,  noting  whether  it  has
sound, is silent, etc.

Indicate  the  presence  or  absence  of  sound  in  the  Manifestation/Item,  i.e.  “sound,”
“silent,” “mute”, “combined” or “mixed” etc. Selection should be made from a controlled
list of terms. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.4
Manifestation/Item Sound Type.

Record only if this information is not captured at the Manifestation level or if required

at the Item level by the system in use.

3.1.5.4 Sound Channel Configuration

If the Item has sound, note here the track configuration (e.g., mono, stereo, etc.)

Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms.

3.1.5.5 Sound System

See also 2.3.4.3 Sound characteristics of a Manifestation

Describes the technical or proprietary system used to record the sound on a Mani-
festation/Item, for example, Dolby SR, Dolby Digital, etc. Select from a controlled list. A
suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.13 Item Sound System.

3.1.5.6 Colour

For full instructions, see 2.3.4.4 Colour characteristics of a Manifestation.

The presence of colour(s), tone(s), etc. in an Item.117

Record only if this information is not captured at the Manifestation level or if required

at the Item level by the system in use.

3.1.5.7 Unit number

For full instructions see 2.3.5.1 Logical extent of a Manifestation

The number of discrete logical units that make up the moving image Item. Item unit
number(s)  may  differ  from  that  of  the  associated  Manifestation.  The  unit  number  in
Manifestation  relates  to  the  ideal,  whereas  the  Item  unit  number  refers  to  the  actual
units held by the institution, e.g. an institution may have only acquired 3 reels of a 4-reel
film.

117  RDA 7.17.3 Colour of Moving Image



3.1.5.8 Extent

The actual physical/digital extent is a characteristic of a singular Item, since it can be

different for multiple Items exemplifying the same moving image Manifestation.

For film, record footage for the film reel in feet or metres. This footage represents actu-
al length, rather than the “ideal” length, which is recorded for Manifestations (see 2.3.5.2
Physical extent of a Manifestation). If your system allows, provide the Unit of Measure-
ment – feet or metres – in another element. Having separate numeric fields can facilitate
calculations in determining the amount of footage that will be preserved.

For digital files, enter the numerical measurement indicating the size of the digital

asset’s file(s), in KB, MB, GB, or TB.

As above, the Unit of Measurement (feet, metres, GB, etc.) may be provided in a sep-
arate field. This could be two separate fields side by side – one for numbers and one for
size measurement. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in
D.7.9 Item File Size – Digital.

If the length of an Item is uncertain, use a question mark following the unit count or
record the uncertain number preceded by “approximately.” In a note, give an explana-
tion for the estimated footage or metre count, where known.

If  the  length  of  an  Item  is  indeterminate,  record  the  information  using  a  value  of

“unknown.”

Alternatively, provide for a distinguishing “precision” field specifying if the length is

exact, approximate or unknown.

3.1.5.9 Projection characteristics

For full instructions, see 2.3.4.2 Projection characteristics of a Manifestation

The projection characteristics of a Manifestation/Item include aspect ratio and aperture
or image format.

Record only if this information is not captured at the Manifestation level or if required

at the Item level by the system in use.

3.1.5.10 Broadcast standard - Video

The broadcast standard for a video or DVD/BluRay: NTSC, PAL, SECAM.

3.1.5.11 Duration

Duration in minutes of the moving image(s) contained in the Item, not the total dura-
tion of the Manifestation. Optionally, include minutes and seconds, or, for a higher level
of precision and to enable calculations, use the format HH:MM:SS. This numeric format



will help to calculate estimated digital storage in analogue-to-digital transfer projects.

This  duration  represents  actual  temporal  extent,  rather  than  the  “ideal”  temporal
extent, which is recorded for Manifestations (see 2.3.5.3 Duration of a Manifestation).
Actual duration is a characteristic of a singular Item, since it can differ among multiple
Items exemplifying the same Manifestation.

If the duration/running time of an Item is uncertain, use a question mark following
the unit count or record the uncertain number preceded by “approximately.” If necessary,
in a note, give an explanation for the estimated duration/running time, where known.

If the duration/running time of an Item is indeterminate, record the information us-

ing a value of “unknown.”

Alternatively, provide for a distinguishing “precision” field specifying if the duration/
running time is exact, approximate or unknown. If the Item is a video or audio tape where
the tape stock maximum duration is identified (e.g., Fuji M321-SP 30M is a Betacam SP
tape of 30 minutes duration), that maximum duration can be noted in the “precision”
field as “stock maximum.” This information can be helpful since it implies the Item can-
not be longer than the maximum duration of the stock.

3.1.5.11.1 Duration Precision

In this qualifier, note whether the duration is exact, approximate, estimated, or stock

maximum.

3.1.5.12 Frame Rate

Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is open

and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.18 Item Frame Rate/Transfer Speed.

Frame rate is the native frame rate for the Item. Information related to the frame rate
used during a digitisation process is added to Transfer Speed (see 3.1.5.23 Transfer Speed).

Frame Rate and Transfer Speed can sometimes be the same thing, and at other times
different, depending on whether it is an Item that is being scanned into a digital file or an
Item that is a digital file to start with. For example, a silent film that was shot at a 16 fps
frame rate could be transferred at 23.98 fps. In this case, the resulting digital file would
have a frame rate of 23.98, even though the original film is 16 fps.

Precision  can  be  added  to  this  element  by  adding  a  “Type”  qualifier  to  note  if  the

frame rate is original, or the transfer rate.

Note that in digital cinema, a film can have Variable frame rates.



3.1.5.13 Base

The physical material or video format on which the Item is captured, for example, de-
scribing the flexible transparent material that supports a film items’ emulsion or a magnet-
ic track, (e.g., acetate, nitrate, CTA, etc.). Select from controlled list of terms. A suggested
list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.7 Item Base – Film or Video.

3.1.5.14 Stock

Describes the specific stock/brand on which the Item is captured, for example, Eastman
Kodak, Fuji, 3M, etc. This element should be used for all media: film, video, audio, optical,
digital tape, external hard drives. Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms.
A suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.16 Item Stock.

3.1.5.15 Stock batch

The stock batch number of the media the Item is captured on. This can be a video,
audio, optical media, or digital tape stock. Identifying the batch number can assist in
identifying problems related to specific manufactured batches.

3.1.5.16 Video Codec

The video compression standard used in the digital video Item, for example, D10, MP4, etc.

Video  and  digital  cinema  formats  contained  in  wrappers  have  separate  audio  files
contained in the format with the video file. For example, DCPs (contained in MXF files)
are comprised of a JPEG2000 video file and a WAV audio file (along with textual informa-
tion in an XML file), The audio codec is described separately.

Select from controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaus-

tive, can be found in D.7.10 Item Code type – Digital. Other lists include:

3.1.5.17 Audio Codec

The audio compression standard used in the audio file, whether it is contained in a

wrapper with a video file or as a standalone audio file.

Select from controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaus-

tive, can be found in D.7.10 Item Codec type. Other lists include:

3.1.5.18 Resolution

Note whether the Item’s resolution is Standard Definition, High Definition, etc. Selec-
tion should be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is open and
not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.19 Item Resolution.

3.1.5.19 Line standard – Video

Describes the number of scan lines which make up the image and indicates the res-
olution, for example, 405, 525, 1080. Selection should be made from a controlled list of
terms. A suggested list, which is open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.21 Item
Line Standard – Video.

3.1.5.20 Bit Depth

Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is

open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.17 Item Bit Depth – Digital.

Note that bit depth can be used in describing both video and audio files.

3.1.5.21 Source Device

Record the source playback device used in transfer projects. This can be a video deck,

film printer, or hardware.

Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is
open and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.20 Item Source Device – Digital D.7.20 Item
Source Device – Digital.

3.1.5.22 Source Software

Record the source software used in playing a digital file.

3.1.5.23 Transfer Speed

Selection should be made from a controlled list of terms. A suggested list, which is open

and not exhaustive, can be found in D.7.18 Item Frame Rate/Transfer Speed – Digital.

If the Transfer Speed is the same as the Frame Rate (3.1.5.12 Frame Rate), these values
should be the same. However, silent films might be transferred at a higher speed than



the original frame rate. For example, a silent film that was shot at a 16fps frame rate
could be transferred at 23.98 fps. It is important to note the transfer speed so an institu-
tion can identify how the transferred Item compares to the source Item. If the transfer
speed is faster than the source frame rate, the target Item could have a shorter duration
than the source Item.
