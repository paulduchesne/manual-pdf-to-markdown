1.3.4.2 Date Precision

Where  possible,  provide  a  “Date  Precision”  qualifier  to  note  if  the  date  is  precise,
approximate, estimated, or a range. EDTF also provides codes to denote precision. For
example, an uncertain or approximate date may be formatted thus: 2004-06~-11 (year
and month are approximate; day known). Using a Date Precision qualifier, this Date en-
try could be entered as:

Date:
Date Type:
Date Precision:

2004-06-11
Creation
Approximate

An institution may choose to use a precision qualifier for imprecise dates.

If ISO formatting and/or the Date Precision qualifier are not applied, then use consis-

tent terms and formatting to note date approximations.
